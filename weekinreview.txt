STRUCTURE OF A PREHANDOVER MAMMALIAN RIBOSOMAL SRP{MIDDLE DOT}SRP RECEPTOR TARGETING COMPLEX
----------------------------------------
<p>Signal recognition particle (SRP) targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SRP recognizes the ribosome synthesizing a signal sequence and delivers it to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane followed by the transfer of the signal sequence to the translocon. Here, we present the cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structure of the mammalian translating ribosome in complex with SRP and SR in a conformation preceding signal sequence handover. The structure visualizes all eukaryotic-specific SRP and SR proteins and reveals their roles in stabilizing this conformation by forming a large protein assembly at the distal site of SRP RNA. We provide biochemical evidence that the guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis of SRP&middot;SR is delayed at this stage, possibly to provide a time window for signal sequence handover to the translocon.</p>

DEVELOPMENTAL AND ONCOGENIC PROGRAMS IN H3K27M GLIOMAS DISSECTED BY SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ
----------------------------------------
<p>Gliomas with histone H3 lysine27-to-methionine mutations (H3K27M-glioma) arise primarily in the midline of the central nervous system of young children, suggesting a cooperation between genetics and cellular context in tumorigenesis. Although the genetics of H3K27M-glioma are well characterized, their cellular architecture remains uncharted. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in 3321 cells from six primary H3K27M-glioma and matched models. We found that H3K27M-glioma primarily contain cells that resemble oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC-like), whereas more differentiated malignant cells are a minority. OPC-like cells exhibit greater proliferation and tumor-propagating potential than their more differentiated counterparts and are at least in part sustained by <i>PDGFRA</i> signaling. Our study characterizes oncogenic and developmental programs in H3K27M-glioma at single-cell resolution and across genetic subclones, suggesting potential therapeutic targets in this disease.</p>

During translation, consecutive ribosomes load on an mRNA and form a polysome. The first ribosome binds to a single-stranded mRNA region and moves toward the start codon, unwinding potential mRNA structures on the way. In contrast, the following ribosomes can dock at the start codon only when the first ribosome...

AN INTERPLAY OF MIRNA ABUNDANCE AND TARGET SITE ARCHITECTURE DETERMINES MIRNA ACTIVITY AND SPECIFICITY
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>MicroRNAs often occur in families whose members share an identical 5′ terminal ‘seed’ sequence. The seed is a major determinant of miRNA activity, and family members are thought to act redundantly on target mRNAs with perfect seed matches, i.e. sequences complementary to the seed. However, recently sequences outside the seed were reported to promote silencing by individual miRNA family members. Here, we examine this concept and the importance of miRNA specificity for the robustness of developmental gene control. Using the <span style="font-style: italic;">let-7</span> miRNA family in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, we find that seed match imperfections can increase specificity by requiring extensive pairing outside the miRNA seed region for efficient silencing and that such specificity is needed for faithful worm development. In addition, for some target site architectures, elevated miRNA levels can compensate for a lack of complementarity outside the seed. Thus, some target sites require higher miRNA concentration for silencing than others, contrasting with a traditional binary distinction between functional and non-functional sites. We conclude that changing miRNA concentrations can alter cellular miRNA target repertoires. This diversifies possible biological outcomes of miRNA-mediated gene regulation and stresses the importance of target validation under physiological conditions to understand miRNA functions <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span>.</span>

VIFI: ACCURATE DETECTION OF VIRAL INTEGRATION AND MRNA FUSION REVEALS INDISCRIMINATE AND UNREGULATED TRANSCRIPTION IN PROXIMAL GENOMIC REGIONS IN CERVICAL CANCER
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The integration of viral sequences into the host genome is an important driver of tumorigenesis in many viral mediated cancers, notably cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. We present ViFi, a computational method that combines phylogenetic methods with reference-based read mapping to detect viral integrations. In contrast with read-based reference mapping approaches, ViFi is faster, and shows high precision and sensitivity on both simulated and biological data, even when the integrated virus is a novel strain or highly mutated. We applied ViFi to matched genomic and mRNA data from 68 cervical cancer samples from TCGA and found high concordance between the two. Surprisingly, viral integration resulted in a dramatic transcriptional upregulation in all proximal elements, including LINEs and LTRs that are not normally transcribed. This upregulation is highly correlated with the presence of a viral gene fused with a downstream human element. Moreover, genomic rearrangements suggest the formation of apparent circular extrachromosomal (ecDNA) human-viral structures. Our results suggest the presence of apparent small circular fusion viral/human ecDNA, which correlates with indiscriminate and unregulated expression of proximal genomic elements, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of HPV-associated cervical cancers.

A THREONYL-TRNA SYNTHETASE-LIKE PROTEIN HAS TRNA AMINOACYLATION AND EDITING ACTIVITIES
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><span style="font-style: italic;">TARS</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">TARS2</span> encode cytoplasmic and mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetases (ThrRSs) in mammals, respectively. Interestingly, in higher eukaryotes, a third gene, <span style="font-style: italic;">TARSL2</span>, encodes a ThrRS-like protein (ThrRS-L), which is highly homologous to cytoplasmic ThrRS but with a different N-terminal extension (N-extension). Whether ThrRS-L has canonical functions is unknown. In this work, we studied the organ expression pattern, cellular localization, canonical aminoacylation and editing activities of mouse ThrRS-L (mThrRS-L). <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarsl2</span> is ubiquitously but unevenly expressed in mouse tissues. Different from mouse cytoplasmic ThrRS (mThrRS), mThrRS-L is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus; the nuclear distribution is mediated via a nuclear localization sequence at its C-terminus. Native mThrRS-L enriched from HEK293T cells was active in aminoacylation and editing. To investigate the <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> catalytic properties of mThrRS-L accurately, we replaced the N-extension of mThrRS-L with that of mThrRS. The chimeric protein (mThrRS-L-N<sup>T</sup>) has amino acid activation, aminoacylation and editing activities. We compared the activities and cross-species tRNA recognition between mThrRS-L-N<sup>T</sup> and mThrRS. Despite having a similar aminoacylation activity, mThrRS-L-N<sup>T</sup> and mThrRS exhibit differences in tRNA recognition and editing capacity. Our results provided the first analysis of the aminoacylation and editing activities of ThrRS-L, and improved our understanding of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarsl2</span>.</span>

A COMPREHENSIVE CATALOG OF PREDICTED FUNCTIONAL UPSTREAM OPEN READING FRAMES IN HUMANS
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) latent in mRNA transcripts are thought to modify translation of coding sequences by altering ribosome activity. Not all uORFs are thought to be active in such a process. To estimate the impact of uORFs on the regulation of translation in humans, we first circumscribed the universe of all possible uORFs based on coding gene sequence motifs and identified 1.3 million unique uORFs. To determine which of these are likely to be biologically relevant, we built a simple Bayesian classifier using 89 attributes of uORFs labeled as active in ribosome profiling experiments. This allowed us to extrapolate to a comprehensive catalog of likely functional uORFs. We validated our predictions using in vivo protein levels and ribosome occupancy from 46 individuals. This is a substantially larger catalog of functional uORFs than has previously been reported. Our ranked list of likely active uORFs allows researchers to test their hypotheses regarding the role of uORFs in health and disease. We demonstrate several examples of biological interest through the application of our catalog to somatic mutations in cancer and disease-associated germline variants in humans.</span>

STRUCTURAL BASIS FOR LEISHIF4E-1 MODULATION BY AN INTERACTING PROTEIN IN THE HUMAN PARASITE LEISHMANIA MAJOR
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><span style="font-style: italic;">Leishmania</span> parasites are unicellular pathogens that are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies. Most of the regulation of their gene expression occurs post-transcriptionally, and the different patterns of gene expression required throughout the parasites’ life cycle are regulated at the level of translation. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Leishmania</span> cap-binding isoform 1, LeishIF4E-1, bound to a protein fragment of previously unknown function, Leish4E-IP1, that binds tightly to LeishIF4E-1. The molecular structure, coupled to NMR spectroscopy experiments and <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> cap-binding assays, reveal that Leish4E-IP1 allosterically destabilizes the binding of LeishIF4E-1 to the 5′ mRNA cap. We propose mechanisms through which Leish4E-IP1-mediated LeishIF4E-1 inhibition could regulate translation initiation in the human parasite.</span>

LIMITED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE ACTIVITY OF PHI29 DNA POLYMERASE
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Phi29 (Φ29) DNA polymerase is an enzyme commonly used in DNA amplification methods such as rolling circle amplification (RCA) and multiple strand displacement amplification (MDA), as well as in DNA sequencing methods such as single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing. Here, we report the ability of phi29 DNA polymerase to amplify RNA-containing circular substrates during RCA. We found that circular substrates with single RNA substitutions are amplified at a similar amplification rate as non-chimeric DNA substrates, and that consecutive RNA pyrimidines were generally preferred over purines. We observed RCA suppression with higher number of ribonucleotide substitutions, which was partially restored by interspacing RNA bases with DNA. We show that supplementing manganese ions as cofactor supports replication of RNAs during RCA. Sequencing of the RCA products demonstrated accurate base incorporation at the RNA base with both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> as cofactors during replication, proving reverse transcriptase activity of the phi29 DNA polymerase. In summary, the ability of phi29 DNA polymerase to accept RNA-containing substrates broadens the spectrum of applications for phi29 DNA polymerase-mediated RCA. These include amplification of chimeric circular probes, such as padlock probes and molecular inversion probes.</span>

A SCREEN FOR DEEPLY CONSERVED NON-CODING GWAS SNPS UNCOVERS A MIR-9-2 FUNCTIONAL MUTATION ASSOCIATED TO RETINAL VASCULATURE DEFECTS IN HUMAN
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Thousands of human disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie in the non-coding genome, but only a handful have been demonstrated to affect gene expression and human biology. We computationally identified risk-associated SNPs in deeply conserved non-exonic elements (CNEs) potentially contributing to 45 human diseases. We further demonstrated that human CNE1/rs17421627 associated with retinal vasculature defects showed transcriptional activity in the zebrafish retina, while introducing the risk-associated allele completely abolished CNE1 enhancer activity. Furthermore, deletion of CNE1 led to retinal vasculature defects and to a specific downregulation of <span style="font-style: italic;">microRNA-9</span>, rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">MEF2C</span> as predicted by the original genome-wide association studies. Consistent with these results, <span style="font-style: italic;">miR-9</span> depletion affects retinal vasculature formation, demonstrating <span style="font-style: italic;">MIR-9-2</span> as a critical gene underpinning the associated trait. Importantly, we validated that other CNEs act as transcriptional enhancers that can be disrupted by conserved non-coding SNPs. This study uncovers disease-associated non-coding mutations that are deeply conserved, providing a path for <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> testing to reveal their <span style="font-style: italic;">cis</span>-regulated genes and biological roles.</span>

THE YEAST TY1 RETROTRANSPOSON REQUIRES COMPONENTS OF THE NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX FOR TRANSCRIPTION AND GENOMIC INTEGRATION
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) orchestrate cargo between the cytoplasm and nucleus and regulate chromatin organization. NPC proteins, or nucleoporins (Nups), are required for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression and genomic integration of viral DNA. We utilize the Ty1 retrotransposon of <span style="font-style: italic;">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">S. cerevisiae</span>) to study retroviral integration because retrotransposons are the progenitors of retroviruses and have conserved integrase (IN) enzymes. Ty1-IN targets Ty1 elements into the genome upstream of RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcribed genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Evidence that <span style="font-style: italic;">S. cerevisiae</span> tRNA genes are recruited to NPCs prompted our investigation of a functional role for the NPC in Ty1 targeting into the genome. We find that Ty1 mobility is reduced in multiple Nup mutants that cannot be accounted for by defects in Ty1 gene expression, cDNA production or Ty1-IN nuclear entry. Instead, we find that Ty1 insertion upstream of tRNA genes is impaired. We also identify Nup mutants with wild type Ty1 mobility but impaired Ty1 targeting. The NPC nuclear basket, which interacts with chromatin, is required for both Ty1 expression and nucleosome targeting. Deletion of components of the NPC nuclear basket causes mis-targeting of Ty1 elements to the ends of chromosomes.</span>

CELLULAR UPTAKE MEDIATED BY EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR FACILITATES THE INTRACELLULAR ACTIVITY OF PHOSPHOROTHIOATE-MODIFIED ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) with phosphorothioate (PS) linkages have been extensively studied as research and therapeutic agents. PS-ASOs can enter the cell and trigger cleavage of complementary RNA by RNase H1 even in the absence of transfection reagent. A number of cell surface proteins have been identified that bind PS-ASOs and mediate their cellular uptake; however, the mechanisms that lead to productive internalization of PS-ASOs are not well understood. Here, we characterized the interaction between PS-ASOs and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We found that PS-ASOs trafficked together with EGF and EGFR into clathrin-coated pit structures. Their co-localization was also observed at early endosomes and inside enlarged late endosomes. Reduction of EGFR decreased PS-ASO activity without affecting EGF-mediated signaling pathways and overexpression of EGFR increased PS-ASO activity in cells. Furthermore, reduction of EGFR delays PS-ASO trafficking from early to late endosomes. Thus, EGFR binds to PS-ASOs at the cell surface and mediates essential steps for active (productive) cellular uptake of PS-ASOs through its cargo-dependent trafficking processes which migrate PS-ASOs from early to late endosomes. This EGFR-mediated process can also serve as an additional model to better understand the mechanism of intracellular uptake and endosomal release of PS-ASOs.</span>

GENOME-WIDE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN R-LOOP FORMATION AND ANTISENSE TRANSCRIPTION IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Transcription termination by Rho is essential for viability in various bacteria, including some major pathogens. Since Rho acts by targeting nascent RNAs that are not simultaneously translated, it also regulates antisense transcription. Here we show that RNase H-deficient mutants of <span style="font-style: italic;">Escherichia coli</span> exhibit heightened sensitivity to the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin, and that Rho deficiency provokes increased formation of RNA–DNA hybrids (R-loops) which is ameliorated by expression of the phage T4-derived R-loop helicase UvsW. We also provide evidence that in Rho-deficient cells, R-loop formation blocks subsequent rounds of antisense transcription at more than 500 chromosomal loci. Hence these antisense transcripts, which can extend beyond 10 kb in their length, are only detected when Rho function is absent or compromised and the UvsW helicase is concurrently expressed. Thus the potential for antisense transcription in bacteria is much greater than hitherto recognized; and the cells are able to retain viability even when nearly one-quarter of their total non-rRNA abundance is accounted for by antisense transcripts, provided that R-loop formation from them is curtailed.</span>

GENETIC INSTABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH LOOP OR STEM–LOOP STRUCTURES WITHIN TRANSCRIPTION UNITS CAN BE INDEPENDENT OF NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are found throughout the genome, and under some conditions can change in length over time. Germline and somatic expansions of trinucleotide repeats are associated with a series of severely disabling illnesses, including Huntington's disease. The underlying mechanisms that effect SSR expansions and contractions have been experimentally elusive, but models suggesting a role for DNA repair have been proposed, in particular the involvement of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCNER) that removes transcription-blocking DNA damage from the transcribed strand of actively expressed genes. If the formation of secondary DNA structures that are associated with SSRs were to block RNA polymerase progression, TCNER could be activated, resulting in the removal of the aberrant structure and a concomitant change in the region's length. To test this, TCNER activity in primary human fibroblasts was assessed on defined DNA substrates containing extrahelical DNA loops that lack discernible internal base pairs or DNA stem–loops that contain base pairs within the stem. The results show that both structures impede transcription elongation, but there is no corresponding evidence that nucleotide excision repair (NER) or TCNER operates to remove them.</span>

COMBINED CISTROME AND TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS OF SKI IN AML CELLS IDENTIFIES SKI AS A CO-REPRESSOR FOR RUNX1
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>SKI is a transcriptional co-regulator and overexpressed in various human tumors, for example in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SKI contributes to the origin and maintenance of the leukemic phenotype. Here, we use ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis to identify the epigenetic alterations induced by SKI overexpression in AML cells. We show that approximately two thirds of differentially expressed genes are up-regulated upon SKI deletion, of which &gt;40% harbor SKI binding sites in their proximity, primarily in enhancer regions. Gene ontology analysis reveals that many of the differentially expressed genes are annotated to hematopoietic cell differentiation and inflammatory response, corroborating our finding that SKI contributes to a myeloid differentiation block in HL60 cells. We find that SKI peaks are enriched for RUNX1 consensus motifs, particularly in up-regulated SKI targets upon SKI deletion. RUNX1 ChIP-seq displays that nearly 70% of RUNX1 binding sites overlap with SKI peaks, mainly at enhancer regions. SKI and RUNX1 occupy the same genomic sites and cooperate in gene silencing. Our work demonstrates for the first time the predominant co-repressive function of SKI in AML cells on a genome-wide scale and uncovers the transcription factor RUNX1 as an important mediator of SKI-dependent transcriptional repression.</span>

RNA–DNA HYBRIDS PROMOTE THE EXPANSION OF FRIEDREICH'S ATAXIA (GAA)N REPEATS VIA BREAK-INDUCED REPLICATION
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Expansion of simple DNA repeats is responsible for numerous hereditary diseases in humans. The role of DNA replication, repair and transcription in the expansion process has been well documented. Here we analyzed, in a yeast experimental system, the role of RNA–DNA hybrids in genetic instability of long (GAA)<sub>n</sub> repeats, which cause Friedreich’s ataxia. Knocking out both yeast RNase H enzymes, which counteract the formation of RNA–DNA hybrids, increased (GAA)<sub>n</sub> repeat expansion and contraction rates when the repetitive sequence was transcribed. Unexpectedly, we observed a similar increase in repeat instability in RNase H-deficient cells when we either changed the direction of transcription-replication collisions, or flipped the repeat sequence such that the (UUC)<sub>n</sub> run occurred in the transcript. The increase in repeat expansions in RNase H-deficient strains was dependent on Rad52 and Pol32 proteins, suggesting that break-induced replication (BIR) is responsible for this effect. We conclude that expansions of (GAA)<sub>n</sub> repeats are induced by the formation of RNA–DNA hybrids that trigger BIR. Since this stimulation is independent of which strand of the repeat (homopurine or homopyrimidine) is in the RNA transcript, we hypothesize that triplex H-DNA structures stabilized by an RNA–DNA hybrid (H-loops), rather than conventional R-loops, could be responsible.</span>

AN RNA-DEPENDENT MECHANISM FOR TRANSIENT EXPRESSION OF BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION FILAMENTS
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prokaryotic RNA chaperone Hfq mediates sRNA–mRNA interactions and plays a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation of the type III secretion (T3S) system produced by a range of <span style="font-style: italic;">Escherichia coli</span> pathotypes. UV-crosslinking was used to map Hfq-binding under conditions that promote T3S and multiple interactions were identified within polycistronic transcripts produced from the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) that encodes the T3S system. The majority of Hfq binding was within the LEE5 and LEE4 operons, the latter encoding the translocon apparatus (SepL-EspADB) that is positively regulated by the RNA binding protein, CsrA. Using the identified Hfq-binding sites and a series of sRNA deletions, the sRNA Spot42 was shown to directly repress translation of LEE4 at the <span style="font-style: italic;">sepL</span> 5′ UTR. <span style="font-style: italic;">In silico</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> analyses of the <span style="font-style: italic;">sepL</span> mRNA secondary structure combined with expression studies of truncates indicated that the unbound <span style="font-style: italic;">sepL</span> mRNA is translationally inactive. Based on expression studies with site-directed mutants, an OFF-ON-OFF toggle model is proposed that results in transient translation of SepL and EspA filament assembly. Under this model, the nascent mRNA is translationally off, before being activated by CsrA, and then repressed by Hfq and Spot42.</span>

THE SM-CORE MEDIATES THE RETENTION OF PARTIALLY-ASSEMBLED SPLICEOSOMAL SNRNPS IN CAJAL BODIES UNTIL THEIR FULL MATURATION
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear non-membrane bound organelles where small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) undergo their final maturation and quality control before they are released to the nucleoplasm. However, the molecular mechanism how immature snRNPs are targeted and retained in CBs has yet to be described. Here, we microinjected and expressed various snRNA deletion mutants as well as chimeric 7SK, Alu or bacterial SRP non-coding RNAs and provide evidence that Sm and SMN binding sites are necessary and sufficient for CB localization of snRNAs. We further show that Sm proteins, and specifically their GR-rich domains, are important for accumulating snRNPs in CBs. Accordingly, core snRNPs containing the Sm proteins, but not naked snRNAs, restore the formation of CBs after their depletion. Finally, we show that immature but not fully assembled snRNPs are able to induce CB formation and that microinjection of an excess of U2 snRNP-specific proteins, which promotes U2 snRNP maturation, chases U2 snRNA from CBs. We propose that the accessibility of the Sm ring represents the molecular basis for the quality control of the final maturation of snRNPs and the sequestration of immature particles in CBs.</span>

STRUCTURAL ANALYSES OF NEAT1 LNCRNAS SUGGEST LONG-RANGE RNA INTERACTIONS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO PARASPECKLE ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies that regulate multiple aspects of gene expression. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 is essential for paraspeckle formation. NEAT1 has a highly ordered spatial organization within the paraspeckle, such that its 5′ and 3′ ends localize on the periphery of paraspeckle, while central sequences of NEAT1 are found within the paraspeckle core. As such, the structure of NEAT1 RNA may be important as a scaffold for the paraspeckle. In this study, we used SHAPE probing and computational analyses to investigate the secondary structure of human and mouse NEAT1. We propose a secondary structural model of the shorter (3,735 nt) isoform hNEAT1_S, in which the RNA folds into four separate domains. The secondary structures of mouse and human NEAT1 are largely different, with the exception of several short regions that have high structural similarity. Long-range base-pairing interactions between the 5′ and 3′ ends of the long isoform NEAT1 (NEAT1_L) were predicted computationally and verified using an <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> RNA–RNA interaction assay. These results suggest that the conserved role of NEAT1 as a paraspeckle scaffold does not require extensively conserved RNA secondary structure and that long-range interactions among NEAT1 transcripts may have an important architectural function in paraspeckle formation.</span>

INTEGRATIVE TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING REVEALS EXTENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TRANS-SPLICING AND CIS-BACKSPLICING IN HUMAN CELLS
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Transcriptionally non-co-linear (NCL) transcripts can originate from <span style="font-style: italic;">trans</span>-splicing (<span style="font-style: italic;">trans</span>-spliced RNA; ‘tsRNA’) or <span style="font-style: italic;">cis</span>-backsplicing (circular RNA; ‘circRNA’). While numerous circRNAs have been detected in various species, tsRNAs remain largely uninvestigated. Here, we utilize integrative transcriptome sequencing of poly(A)- and non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from diverse human cell lines to distinguish between tsRNAs and circRNAs. We identified 24,498 NCL events and found that a considerable proportion (20–35%) of them arise from both tsRNAs and circRNAs, representing extensive alternative <span style="font-style: italic;">trans</span>-splicing and <span style="font-style: italic;">cis</span>-backsplicing in human cells. We show that sequence generalities of exon circularization are also observed in tsRNAs. Recapitulation of NCL RNAs further shows that inverted <span style="font-style: italic;">Alu</span> repeats can simultaneously promote the formation of tsRNAs and circRNAs. However, tsRNAs and circRNAs exhibit quite different, or even opposite, expression patterns, in terms of correlation with the expression of their co-linear counterparts, expression breadth/abundance, transcript stability, and subcellular localization preference. These results indicate that tsRNAs and circRNAs may play different regulatory roles and analysis of NCL events should take the joint effects of different NCL-splicing types and joint effects of multiple NCL events into consideration. This study describes the first transcriptome-wide analysis of <span style="font-style: italic;">trans</span>-splicing and <span style="font-style: italic;">cis</span>-backsplicing, expanding our understanding of the complexity of the human transcriptome.</span>

PUMILIO DIRECTS DEADENYLATION-ASSOCIATED TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION OF THE CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 1 ACTIVATOR RGC-32
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Response gene to complement-32 (RGC-32) activates cyclin-dependent kinase 1, regulates the cell cycle and is deregulated in many human tumours. We previously showed that RGC-32 expression is upregulated by the cancer-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in latently infected B cells through the relief of translational repression. We now show that EBV infection of naïve primary B cells also induces RGC-32 protein translation. In EBV-immortalised cell lines, we found that RGC-32 depletion resulted in cell death, indicating a key role in B cell survival. Studying RGC-32 translational control in EBV-infected cells, we found that the RGC-32 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) mediates translational repression. Repression was dependent on a single Pumilio binding element (PBE) adjacent to the polyadenylation signal. Mutation of this PBE did not affect mRNA cleavage, but resulted in increased polyA tail length. Consistent with Pumilio-dependent recruitment of deadenylases, we found that depletion of Pumilio in EBV-infected cells increased RGC-32 protein expression and polyA tail length. The extent of Pumilio binding to the endogenous RGC-32 mRNA in EBV-infected cell lines also correlated with RGC-32 protein expression. Our data demonstrate the importance of RGC-32 for the survival of EBV-immortalised B cells and identify Pumilio as a key regulator of RGC-32 translation.</span>

MATURATION OF THE 90S PRE-RIBOSOME REQUIRES MRD1 DEPENDENT U3 SNORNA AND 35S PRE-RRNA STRUCTURAL REARRANGEMENTS
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis requires folding and assembly of the precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) with a large number of proteins and snoRNPs into huge RNA-protein complexes. In spite of intense genetic, biochemical and high-resolution cryo-EM studies in <span style="font-style: italic;">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, information about the structure of the 35S pre-rRNA is limited. To overcome this, we performed high-throughput SHAPE chemical probing on the 35S pre-rRNA within 90S pre-ribosomes. We focused our analyses on external (5′ETS) and internal (ITS1) transcribed spacers as well as the 18S rRNA region. We show that in the 35S pre-rRNA, the central pseudoknot is not formed and the central core of the 18S rRNA is in an open configuration but becomes more constrained in 20S pre-rRNA. The essential ribosome biogenesis protein Mrd1 influences the structure of the 18S rRNA region locally and is involved in organizing the central pseudoknot and surrounding structures. We demonstrate that U3 snoRNA dynamically interacts with the 35S pre-rRNA and that Mrd1 is required for disrupting U3 snoRNA base pairing interactions in the 5′ETS. We propose that the dynamic U3 snoRNA interactions and Mrd1 are essential for establishing the structure of the central core of 18S rRNA that is required for processing and 40S subunit function.</span>

DICER PARTNER PROTEIN TUNES THE LENGTH OF MIRNAS USING BASE-MISMATCH IN THE PRE-MIRNA STEM
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dicer partner proteins <span style="font-style: italic;">Drosophila</span> Loquacious-PB (Loqs-PB) and human TRBP tune the length of miRNAs produced by Dicer from a subset of pre-miRNAs and thereby alter their target repertoire, by an unknown mechanism. Here, we developed a novel high-throughput method that we named Dram-seq (Dice randomized pre-miRNA pool and seq) to study length distributions of miRNAs produced from thousands of different pre-miRNA variants. Using Dram-seq, we found that a base-mismatch in the pre-miRNA stem can alter the length of miRNAs compared with a base-pair at the same position in both <span style="font-style: italic;">Drosophila</span> and human, and is important for the miRNA length tuning by Loqs-PB. Loqs-PB directly bound base-mismatched nucleotides in the pre-miRNA stem. We speculate that Loqs-PB tunes miRNA length by changing the conformation of base-mismatched nucleotides in the pre-miRNA stem to that of base-paired ones and thereby altering the distance of the pre-miRNA stem.</span>

STRUCTURAL DIVERGENCE CREATES NEW FUNCTIONAL FEATURES IN ALPHAVIRUS GENOMES
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne pathogens that cause human diseases ranging from debilitating arthritis to lethal encephalitis. Studies with Sindbis virus (SINV), which causes fever, rash, and arthralgia in humans, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), which causes encephalitis, have identified RNA structural elements that play key roles in replication and pathogenesis. However, a complete genomic structural profile has not been established for these viruses. We used the structural probing technique SHAPE-MaP to identify structured elements within the SINV and VEEV genomes. Our SHAPE-directed structural models recapitulate known RNA structures, while also identifying novel structural elements, including a new functional element in the nsP1 region of SINV whose disruption causes a defect in infectivity. Although RNA structural elements are important for multiple aspects of alphavirus biology, we found the majority of RNA structures were not conserved between SINV and VEEV. Our data suggest that alphavirus RNA genomes are highly divergent structurally despite similar genomic architecture and sequence conservation; still, RNA structural elements are critical to the viral life cycle. These findings reframe traditional assumptions about RNA structure and evolution: rather than structures being conserved, alphaviruses frequently evolve new structures that may shape interactions with host immune systems or co-evolve with viral proteins.</span>

SELECTIVE TERMINAL METHYLATION OF A TRNA WOBBLE BASE
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Active tRNAs are extensively post-transcriptionally modified, particularly at the wobble position 34 and the position 37 on the 3′-side of the anticodon. The 5-carboxy-methoxy modification of U34 (cmo<sup>5</sup>U34) is present in Gram-negative tRNAs for six amino acids (Ala, Ser, Pro, Thr, Leu and Val), four of which (Ala, Ser, Pro and Thr) have a terminal methyl group to form 5-methoxy-carbonyl-methoxy-uridine (mcmo<sup>5</sup>U34) for higher reading-frame accuracy. The molecular basis for the selective terminal methylation is not understood. Many cmo<sup>5</sup>U34-tRNAs are essential for growth and cannot be substituted for mutational analysis. We show here that, with a novel genetic approach, we have created and isolated mutants of <span style="font-style: italic;">Escherichia coli</span> tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> and tRNA<sup>Val</sup> for analysis of the selective terminal methylation. We show that substitution of G35 in the anticodon of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> inactivates the terminal methylation, whereas introduction of G35 to tRNA<sup>Val</sup> confers it, indicating that G35 is a major determinant for the selectivity. We also show that, in tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, the terminal methylation at U34 is dependent on the primary m<sup>1</sup>G methylation at position 37 but not <span style="font-style: italic;">vice versa</span>, indicating a hierarchical ranking of modifications between positions 34 and 37. We suggest that this hierarchy provides a mechanism to ensure top performance of a tRNA inside of cells.</span>

COMPLETE GENOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS USING THIRD-GENERATION SEQUENCING: A CASE STUDY OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE CEN.PK113-7D
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Completion of eukaryal genomes can be difficult task with the highly repetitive sequences along the chromosomes and short read lengths of second-generation sequencing. <span style="font-style: italic;">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> strain CEN.PK113-7D, widely used as a model organism and a cell factory, was selected for this study to demonstrate the superior capability of very long sequence reads for <span style="font-style: italic;">de novo</span> genome assembly. We generated long reads using two common third-generation sequencing technologies (Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)) and used short reads obtained using Illumina sequencing for error correction. Assembly of the reads derived from all three technologies resulted in complete sequences for all 16 yeast chromosomes, as well as the mitochondrial chromosome, in one step. Further, we identified three types of DNA methylation (5mC, 4mC and 6mA). Comparison between the reference strain S288C and strain CEN.PK113-7D identified chromosomal rearrangements against a background of similar gene content between the two strains. We identified full-length transcripts through ONT direct RNA sequencing technology. This allows for the identification of transcriptional landscapes, including untranslated regions (UTRs) (5′ UTR and 3′ UTR) as well as differential gene expression quantification. About 91% of the predicted transcripts could be consistently detected across biological replicates grown either on glucose or ethanol. Direct RNA sequencing identified many polyadenylated non-coding RNAs, rRNAs, telomere-RNA, long non-coding RNA and antisense RNA. This work demonstrates a strategy to obtain complete genome sequences and transcriptional landscapes that can be applied to other eukaryal organisms.</span>

DRUID: A PIPELINE FOR TRANSCRIPTOME-WIDE MEASUREMENTS OF MRNA STABILITY [BIOINFORMATICS]
----------------------------------------
<p>Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability is an important aspect of gene regulation. The gold standard for measuring mRNA stability transcriptome-wide uses metabolic labeling, biochemical isolation of labeled RNA populations, and high-throughput sequencing. However, difficult normalization procedures have inhibited widespread adoption of this approach. Here, we present DRUID (for determination of rates using intron dynamics), a new computational pipeline that is robust, easy to use, and freely available. Our pipeline uses endogenous introns to normalize time course data and yields reproducible half-lives, even with data sets that were otherwise unusable. DRUID can handle data sets from a variety of organisms, spanning yeast to humans, and we even applied it retroactively on published data sets. We anticipate that DRUID will allow broad application of metabolic labeling for studies of transcript stability.</p>

HYDROLYTIC ACTIVITY OF HUMAN NUDT16 ENZYME ON DINUCLEOTIDE CAP ANALOGS AND SHORT CAPPED OLIGONUCLEOTIDES [REPORT]
----------------------------------------
<p>Human Nudt16 (hNudt16) is a member of the Nudix family of hydrolases, comprising enzymes catabolizing various substrates including canonical (d)NTPs, oxidized (d)NTPs, nonnucleoside polyphosphates, and capped mRNAs. Decapping activity of the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> (X29) Nudt16 homolog was observed in the nucleolus, with a high specificity toward U8 snoRNA. Subsequent studies have reported cytoplasmic localization of mammalian Nudt16 with cap hydrolysis activity initiating RNA turnover, similar to Dcp2. The present study focuses on hNudt16 and its hydrolytic activity toward dinucleotide cap analogs and short capped oligonucleotides. We performed a screening assay for potential dinucleotide and oligonucleotide substrates for hNudt16. Our data indicate that dinucleotide cap analogs and capped oligonucleotides containing guanine base in the first transcribed nucleotide are more susceptible to enzymatic digestion by hNudt16 than their counterparts containing adenine. Furthermore, unmethylated dinucleotides (GpppG and ApppG) and respective oligonucleotides (GpppG-16nt and GpppA-16nt) were hydrolyzed by hNudt16 with greater efficiency than were m<sup>7</sup>GpppG and m<sup>7</sup>GpppG-16nt. In conclusion, we found that hNudt16 hydrolysis of dinucleotide cap analogs and short capped oligonucleotides displayed a broader spectrum specificity than is currently known.</p>

STRONG CONSERVATION OF INBRED MOUSE STRAIN MICRORNA LOCI BUT BROAD VARIATION IN BRAIN MICRORNAS DUE TO RNA EDITING AND ISOMIR EXPRESSION [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p>Diversity in the structure and expression of microRNAs, important regulators of gene expression, arises from SNPs, duplications followed by divergence, production of isomiRs, and RNA editing. Inbred mouse strains and crosses using them are important reference populations for genetic mapping, and as models of human disease. We determined the nature and extent of interstrain miRNA variation by (i) identifying miRNA SNPs in whole-genome sequence data from 36 strains, and (ii) examining miRNA editing and expression in hippocampus (Hpc) and frontal cortex (FCx) of six strains, to facilitate the study of miRNAs in neurobehavioral phenotypes. miRNA loci were strongly conserved among the 36 strains, but even the highly conserved seed region contained 16 SNPs. In contrast, we identified RNA editing in 58.9% of miRNAs, including 11 consistent editing events in the seed region. We confirmed the functional significance of three conserved edits in the miR-379/410 cluster, demonstrating that edited miRNAs gained novel target mRNAs not recognized by the unedited miRNAs. We found significant interstrain differences in miRNA and isomiR expression: Of 779 miRNAs expressed in Hpc and 719 in FCx, 262 were differentially expressed (190 in Hpc, 126 in FCx, 54 in both). We also identified 32 novel miRNA candidates using miRNA prediction tools. Our studies provide the first comprehensive analysis of SNP, isomiR, and RNA editing variation in miRNA loci across inbred mouse strains, and a detailed catalog of expressed miRNAs in Hpc and FCx in six commonly used strains. These findings will facilitate the molecular analysis of neurological and behavioral phenotypes in this model organism.</p>

MOLECULAR DYNAMICS CORRECTLY MODELS THE UNUSUAL MAJOR CONFORMATION OF THE GAGU RNA INTERNAL LOOP AND WITH NMR REVEALS AN UNUSUAL MINOR CONFORMATION [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p>The RNA "GAGU" duplex, (5'GACGAGUGUCA)<sub>2</sub>, contains the internal loop (5'-GAGU-3')<sub>2</sub> , which has two conformations in solution as determined by NMR spectroscopy. The major conformation has a loop structure consisting of <i>trans</i>-Watson&ndash;Crick/Hoogsteen GG pairs, A residues stacked on each other, U residues bulged outside the helix, and all sugars with a C2'-<i>endo</i> conformation. This differs markedly from the internal loops, (5'-GAGC-3')<sub>2</sub>, (5'-AAGU-3')<sub>2</sub>, and (5'-UAGG-3')<sub>2</sub>, which all have <i>cis</i>-Watson&ndash;Crick/Watson&ndash;Crick AG "imino" pairs flanked by <i>cis</i>-Watson&ndash;Crick/Watson&ndash;Crick canonical pairs resulting in maximal hydrogen bonding. Here, molecular dynamics was used to test whether the Amber force field (ff99 + bsc0 + OL3) approximates molecular interactions well enough to keep stable the unexpected conformation of the GAGU major duplex structure and the NMR structures of the duplexes containing (5'-GAGC-3')<sub>2</sub>, (5'-AAGU-3')<sub>2</sub>, and (5'-UAGG-3')<sub>2</sub> internal loops. One-microsecond simulations were repeated four times for each of the duplexes starting in their NMR conformations. With the exception of (5'-UAGG-3')<sub>2</sub>, equivalent simulations were also run starting with alternative conformations. Results indicate that the Amber force field keeps the NMR conformations of the duplexes stable for at least 1 &micro;sec. They also demonstrate an unexpected minor conformation for the (5'-GAGU-3')<sub>2</sub> loop that is consistent with newly measured NMR spectra of duplexes with natural and modified nucleotides. Thus, unrestrained simulations led to the determination of the previously unknown minor conformation. The stability of the native (5'-GAGU-3')<sub>2</sub> internal loop as compared to other loops can be explained by changes in hydrogen bonding and stacking as the flanking bases are changed.</p>

MOLECULAR BARCODING OF VIRAL VECTORS ENABLES MAPPING AND OPTIMIZATION OF MRNA TRANS-SPLICING [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p>Genome editing has proven to be highly potent in the generation of functional gene knockouts in dividing cells. In the CNS however, efficient technologies to repair sequences are yet to materialize. Reprogramming on the mRNA level is an attractive alternative as it provides means to perform in situ editing of coding sequences without nuclease dependency. Furthermore, de novo sequences can be inserted without the requirement of homologous recombination. Such reprogramming would enable efficient editing in quiescent cells (e.g., neurons) with an attractive safety profile for translational therapies. In this study, we applied a novel molecular-barcoded screening assay to investigate RNA <i>trans</i>-splicing in mammalian neurons. Through three alternative screening systems in cell culture and in vivo, we demonstrate that factors determining <i>trans-</i>splicing are reproducible regardless of the screening system. With this screening, we have located the most permissive <i>trans-</i>splicing sequences targeting an intron in the Synapsin I gene. Using viral vectors, we were able to splice full-length fluorophores into the mRNA while retaining very low off-target expression. Furthermore, this approach also showed evidence of functionality in the mouse striatum. However, in its current form, the <i>trans-</i>splicing events are stochastic and the overall activity lower than would be required for therapies targeting loss-of-function mutations. Nevertheless, the herein described barcode-based screening assay provides a unique possibility to screen and map large libraries in single animals or cell assays with very high precision.</p>

ONCOPROTEIN AEG-1 IS AN ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM RNA-BINDING PROTEIN WHOSE INTERACTOME IS ENRICHED IN ORGANELLE RESIDENT PROTEIN-ENCODING MRNAS [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p>Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), an oncogene whose overexpression promotes tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and enhanced chemoresistance, is thought to function primarily as a scaffolding protein, regulating PI3K/Akt and Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling pathways. Here we report that AEG-1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident integral membrane RNA-binding protein (RBP). Examination of the AEG-1 RNA interactome by HITS-CLIP and PAR-CLIP methodologies revealed a high enrichment for endomembrane organelle-encoding transcripts, most prominently those encoding ER resident proteins, and within this cohort, for integral membrane protein-encoding RNAs. Cluster mapping of the AEG-1/RNA interaction sites demonstrated a normalized rank order interaction of coding sequence &gt;5' untranslated region, with 3' untranslated region interactions only weakly represented. Intriguingly, AEG-1/membrane protein mRNA interaction sites clustered downstream from encoded transmembrane domains, suggestive of a role in membrane protein biogenesis. Secretory and cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs were also represented in the AEG-1 RNA interactome, with the latter category notably enriched in genes functioning in mRNA localization, translational regulation, and RNA quality control. Bioinformatic analyses of RNA-binding motifs and predicted secondary structure characteristics indicate that AEG-1 lacks established RNA-binding sites though shares the property of high intrinsic disorder commonly seen in RBPs. These data implicate AEG-1 in the localization and regulation of secretory and membrane protein-encoding mRNAs and provide a framework for understanding AEG-1 function in health and disease.</p>

DETERMINATION OF THE SMALL RNA GCVB REGULON IN THE GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIAL PATHOGEN PASTEURELLA MULTOCIDA AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE GCVB SEED BINDING REGION [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p><i>Pasteurella multocida</i> is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for many important animal diseases. While a number of <i>P. multocida</i> virulence factors have been identified, very little is known about how gene expression and protein production is regulated in this organism. Small RNA (sRNA) molecules are critical regulators that act by binding to specific mRNA targets, often in association with the RNA chaperone protein Hfq. In this study, transcriptomic analysis of the <i>P. multocida</i> strain VP161 revealed a putative sRNA with high identity to GcvB from <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium. High-throughput quantitative liquid proteomics was used to compare the proteomes of the <i>P. multocida</i> VP161 wild-type strain, a <i>gcvB</i> mutant, and a GcvB overexpression strain. These analyses identified 46 proteins that displayed significant differential production after inactivation of <i>gcvB</i>, 36 of which showed increased production. Of the 36 proteins that were repressed by GcvB, 27 were predicted to be involved in amino acid biosynthesis or transport. Bioinformatic analyses of putative <i>P. multocida</i> GcvB target mRNAs identified a strongly conserved 10 nucleotide consensus sequence, 5'-AACACAACAT-3', with the central eight nucleotides identical to the seed binding region present within GcvB mRNA targets in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S.</i> Typhimurium. Using a defined set of seed region mutants, together with a two-plasmid reporter system that allowed for quantification of sRNA&ndash;mRNA interactions, this sequence was confirmed to be critical for the binding of the <i>P. multocida</i> GcvB to the target mRNA, <i>gltA</i>.</p>

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MOLECULAR CROSSTALK WITHIN THE ESSENTIAL GRC3/LAS1 PRE-RRNA PROCESSING COMPLEX [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p>Grc3 is an essential well-conserved eukaryotic polynucleotide kinase (PNK) that cooperates with the endoribonuclease Las1 to process the preribosomal RNA (rRNA). Aside from being dependent upon Las1 for coordinated kinase and nuclease function, little is known about Grc3 substrate specificity and the molecular mechanisms governing kinase activity. Here we characterize the kinase activity of Grc3 and identify key similarities and differences between Grc3 and other polynucleotide kinase family members. In contrast to other PNK family members, Grc3 has distinct substrate preference for RNA substrates in vitro. By disrupting conserved residues found at the Grc3 kinase active site, we identified specific residues required to support Grc3-directed Las1-mediated pre-rRNA cleavage in vitro and in vivo. The crosstalk between Grc3 and Las1 ensures the direct coupling of cleavage and phosphorylation during pre-rRNA processing. Taken together, our studies provide key insight into the polynucleotide kinase activity of the essential enzyme Grc3 and its molecular crosstalk with the endoribonuclease Las1.</p>

TUDOR STAPHYLOCOCCAL NUCLEASE IS A STRUCTURE-SPECIFIC RIBONUCLEASE THAT DEGRADES RNA AT UNSTRUCTURED REGIONS DURING MICRORNA DECAY [ARTICLE]
----------------------------------------
<p>Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (TSN) is an evolutionarily conserved ribonuclease in eukaryotes that is composed of five staphylococcal nuclease-like domains (SN1&ndash;SN5) and a Tudor domain. TSN degrades hyper-edited double-stranded RNA, including primary miRNA precursors containing multiple I&bull;U and U&bull;I pairs, and mature miRNA during miRNA decay. However, how TSN binds and degrades its RNA substrates remains unclear. Here, we show that the <i>C. elegans</i> TSN (cTSN) is a monomeric Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ribonuclease, cleaving RNA chains at the 5'-side of the phosphodiester linkage to produce degraded fragments with 5'-hydroxyl and 3'-phosphate ends. cTSN degrades single-stranded RNA and double-stranded RNA containing mismatched base pairs, but is not restricted to those containing multiple I&bull;U and U&bull;I pairs. cTSN has at least two catalytic active sites located in the SN1 and SN3 domains, since mutations of the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues in these two domains strongly impaired its ribonuclease activity. We further show by small-angle X-ray scattering that rice osTSN has a flexible two-lobed structure with open to closed conformations, indicating that TSN may change its conformation upon RNA binding. We conclude that TSN is a structure-specific ribonuclease targeting not only single-stranded RNA, but also unstructured regions of double-stranded RNA. This study provides the molecular basis for how TSN cooperates with RNA editing to eliminate duplex RNA in cell defense, and how TSN selects and degrades RNA during microRNA decay.</p>

MONITORING THE 5-METHOXYCARBONYLMETHYL-2-THIOURIDINE (MCM5S2U) MODIFICATION IN EUKARYOTIC TRNAS VIA THE {GAMMA}-TOXIN ENDONUCLEASE [METHOD]
----------------------------------------
<p>The post-transcriptional modification of tRNA at the wobble position is a universal process occurring in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, the wobble uridine of particular tRNAs is transformed to the 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) modification which is critical for proper mRNA decoding and protein translation. However, current methods to detect mcm5s2U are technically challenging and/or require specialized instrumental expertise. Here, we show that -toxin endonuclease from the yeast <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i> can be used as a probe for assaying mcm5s2U status in the tRNA of diverse eukaryotic organisms ranging from protozoans to mammalian cells. The assay couples the mcm5s2U-dependent cleavage of tRNA by -toxin with standard molecular biology techniques such as northern blot analysis or quantitative PCR to monitor mcm5s2U levels in multiple tRNA isoacceptors. The results gained from the -toxin assay reveals the evolutionary conservation of the mcm5s2U modification across eukaryotic species. Moreover, we have used the -toxin assay to verify uncharacterized eukaryotic Trm9 and Trm112 homologs that catalyze the formation of mcm5s2U. These findings demonstrate the use of -toxin as a detection method to monitor mcm5s2U status in diverse eukaryotic cell types for cellular, genetic, and biochemical studies.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Summary</div>RNA-Seq is becoming the technique of choice for high-throughput transcriptome profiling, which, besides class comparison for differential expression, promises to be an effective and powerful tool for biomarker discovery. However, a systematic analysis of high-dimensional genomic data is a demanding task for such a purpose. DaMiRseq offers an organized, flexible and convenient framework to remove noise and bias, select the most informative features and perform accurate classification.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and implementation</div>DaMiRseq is developed for the R environment (R ≥ 3.4) and is released under GPL (≥2) License.

CLASSIFYING NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING DATA USING A ZERO-INFLATED POISSON MODEL
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>With the development of high-throughput techniques, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative for gene expression analysis, such as RNAs profiling and classification. Identifying which type of diseases a new patient belongs to with RNA-seq data has been recognized as a vital problem in medical research. As RNA-seq data are discrete, statistical methods developed for classifying microarray data cannot be readily applied for RNA-seq data classification. Witten proposed a Poisson linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) to classify the RNA-seq data in 2011. Note, however, that the count datasets are frequently characterized by excess zeros in real RNA-seq or microRNA sequence data (i.e. when the sequence depth is not enough or small RNAs with the length of 18–30 nucleotides). Therefore, it is desired to develop a new model to analyze RNA-seq data with an excess of zeros.<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>In this paper, we propose a Zero-Inflated Poisson Logistic Discriminant Analysis (ZIPLDA) for RNA-seq data with an excess of zeros. The new method assumes that the data are from a mixture of two distributions: one is a point mass at zero, and the other follows a Poisson distribution. We then consider a logistic relation between the probability of observing zeros and the mean of the genes and the sequencing depth in the model. Simulation studies show that the proposed method performs better than, or at least as well as, the existing methods in a wide range of settings. Two real datasets including a breast cancer RNA-seq dataset and a microRNA-seq dataset are also analyzed, and they coincide with the simulation results that our proposed method outperforms the existing competitors.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and implementation</div>The software is available at <a href="http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/&amp;sim;tongt">http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/∼tongt</a>.<div class="boxTitle">Contact</div><a href="mailto:'xwan@comp.hkbu.edu.hk'">xwan@comp.hkbu.edu.hk</a> or <a href="mailto:'tongt@hkbu.edu.hk'">tongt@hkbu.edu.hk</a><div class="boxTitle">Supplementary information</div>Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at <span style="font-style: italic;">Bioinformatics</span> online.</span>

ASELUX: AN ULTRA-FAST AND ACCURATE ALLELIC READS COUNTER
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>Mapping bias causes preferential alignment to the reference allele, forming a major obstacle in allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis. The existing methods, such as simulation and SNP-aware alignment, are either inaccurate or relatively slow. To fast and accurately count allelic reads for ASE analysis, we developed a novel approach, ASElux, which utilizes the personal SNP information and counts allelic reads directly from unmapped RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) data. ASElux significantly reduces runtime by disregarding reads outside single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) during the alignment.<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>When compared to other tools on simulated and experimental data, ASElux achieves a higher accuracy on ASE estimation than non-SNP-aware aligners and requires a much shorter time than the benchmark SNP-aware aligner, GSNAP with just a slight loss in performance. ASElux can process 40 million read-pairs from an RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) sample and count allelic reads within 10 min, which is comparable to directly counting the allelic reads from alignments based on other tools. Furthermore, processing an RNA-seq sample using ASElux in conjunction with a general aligner, such as STAR, is more accurate and still ∼4× faster than STAR + WASP, and ∼33× faster than the lead SNP-aware aligner, GSNAP, making ASElux ideal for ASE analysis of large-scale transcriptomic studies. We applied ASElux to 273 lung RNA-seq samples from GTEx and identified a splice-QTL rs11078928 in lung which explains the mechanism underlying an asthma GWAS SNP rs11078927. Thus, our analysis demonstrated ASE as a highly powerful complementary tool to cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and implementation</div>The software can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/abl0719/ASElux">https://github.com/abl0719/ASElux</a>.<div class="boxTitle">Contact</div><a href="mailto:'zmiao@ucla.edu'">zmiao@ucla.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:'a5ko@ucla.edu'">a5ko@ucla.edu</a><div class="boxTitle">Supplementary information</div>Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at <span style="font-style: italic;">Bioinformatics</span> online.</span>

MODELING POSITIONAL EFFECTS OF REGULATORY SEQUENCES WITH SPLINE TRANSFORMATIONS INCREASES PREDICTION ACCURACY OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
----------------------------------------
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>Regulatory sequences are not solely defined by their nucleic acid sequence but also by their relative distances to genomic landmarks such as transcription start site, exon boundaries or polyadenylation site. Deep learning has become the approach of choice for modeling regulatory sequences because of its strength to learn complex sequence features. However, modeling relative distances to genomic landmarks in deep neural networks has not been addressed.<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>Here we developed spline transformation, a neural network module based on splines to flexibly and robustly model distances. Modeling distances to various genomic landmarks with spline transformations significantly increased state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> RNA-binding protein binding sites for 120 out of 123 proteins. We also developed a deep neural network for human splice branchpoint based on spline transformations that outperformed the current best, already distance-based, machine learning model. Compared to piecewise linear transformation, as obtained by composition of rectified linear units, spline transformation yields higher prediction accuracy as well as faster and more robust training. As spline transformation can be applied to further quantities beyond distances, such as methylation or conservation, we foresee it as a versatile component in the genomics deep learning toolbox.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and implementation</div>Spline transformation is implemented as a Keras layer in the CONCISE python package: <a href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/concise">https://github.com/gagneurlab/concise</a>.

		Computational modeling and simulation combined with NMR and fluorescence experiments inform and resolve a controversy on tRNA selectivity in the ribosome.</li>
	<li>
		Free energy calculations of adenine flipping for A-site adenines 1492/1493 indicate that 3–4 kcal/mol selectivity arises from coupling adenines with the mRNA–tRNA minihelix.</li>
	<li>
		The strain associated with moving from the more open form and the closed form accounts for nearly 4 kcal/mol in selectivity.</li>
	<li>
		The free energy cost of keto to enol tautomerization is about 7 kcal/mol in the context of the ribosome with bound tRNA and mRNA, thus suggesting that it is unlikely.</li>
