     INTRAVENOUS DELIVERY OF A MULTI-MECHANISTIC CANCER-TARGETED ONCOLYTIC POXVIRUS IN HUMANS
     ........................................
     The efficacy and safety of biological molecules in cancer therapy, such as peptides and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), could be markedly increased if high concentrations could be achieved and amplified selectively in tumour tissues versus normal tissues after intravenous administration. This has not been achievable so far in humans. We hypothesized that a poxvirus, which evolved for blood-borne systemic spread in mammals, could be engineered for cancer-selective replication and used as a vehicle for the intravenous delivery and expression of transgenes in tumours. JX-594 is an oncolytic poxvirus engineered for replication, transgene expression and amplification in cancer cells harbouring activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Ras pathway, followed by cell lysis and anticancer immunity. Here we show in a clinical trial that JX-594 selectively infects, replicates and expresses transgene products in cancer tissue after intravenous infusion, in a dose-related fashion. Normal tissues were not affected clinically. This platform technology opens up the possibility of multifunctional products that selectively express high concentrations of several complementary therapeutic and imaging molecules in metastatic solid tumours in humans.

     THE EARLY HISTORY OF TUMOR VIROLOGY: ROUS, RIF, AND RAV [PERSPECTIVES]
     ........................................
     One hundred years ago Peyton Rous recovered a virus, now known as the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), from a chicken sarcoma, which reproduced all aspects of the tumor on injection into closely related chickens. There followed recovery of causal viruses of tumors of different morphology from 4 more of 60 chicken tumors. Subsequent studies in chickens of the biology of the first RSV isolated moved slowly for 45 y until an assay of ectodermal pocks of the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos was introduced. The inadequacies of that assay were resolved with the production of transformed foci in cultures of chicken fibroblasts. There followed a productive period on the dynamics of RSV infection. An avian leukosis virus (ALV) was found in some chicken embryos and named resistance-inducing factor (RIF) because it interferes with RSV. Its epidemiology in chickens is described. Another ALV was found in stocks of RSV and called Rous-associated virus (RAV). Cells preinfected with RAV interfere with RSV infection, but RSV does not produce infectious virus unless RAV is added during or after RSV infection. Intracellular RAV provides the infectious coat for the otherwise defective RSV. The coat determines the antigenicity, host range, and maturation rate of RSV. RSV particles carry reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that converts their RNA into DNA and allows integration into the cell's DNA, where it functions as a cellular gene. This was the bridge that joined the biological era to the molecular era. Its relation to oncogenes and human cancer is discussed.

     PARALLEL ADAPTIVE FEEDBACK ENHANCES RELIABILITY OF THE CA2+ SIGNALING SYSTEM [CELL BIOLOGY]
     ........................................
     Despite large cell-to-cell variations in the concentrations of individual signaling proteins, cells transmit signals correctly. This phenomenon raises the question of what signaling systems do to prevent a predicted high failure rate. Here we combine quantitative modeling, RNA interference, and targeted selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry, and we show for the ubiquitous and fundamental calcium signaling system that cells monitor cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ levels and adjust in parallel the concentrations of the store-operated Ca2+ influx mediator stromal interaction molecule (STIM), the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump plasma membrane Ca–ATPase (PMCA), and the ER Ca2+ pump sarco/ER Ca2+–ATPase (SERCA). Model calculations show that this combined parallel regulation in protein expression levels effectively stabilizes basal cytosolic and ER Ca2+ levels and preserves receptor signaling. Our results demonstrate that, rather than directly controlling the relative level of signaling proteins in a forward regulation strategy, cells prevent transmission failure by sensing the state of the signaling pathway and using multiple parallel adaptive feedbacks.

     MITOCHONDRIAL-ASSOCIATED ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM MEMBRANES (MAM) FORM INNATE IMMUNE SYNAPSES AND ARE TARGETED BY HEPATITIS C VIRUS [IMMUNOLOGY]
     ........................................
     RIG-I is a cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor that engages viral RNA in infected cells to trigger innate immune defenses through its adaptor protein MAVS. MAVS resides on mitochondria and peroxisomes, but how its signaling is coordinated among these organelles has not been defined. Here we show that a major site of MAVS signaling is the mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM), a distinct membrane compartment that links the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. During RNA virus infection, RIG-I is recruited to the MAM to bind MAVS. Dynamic MAM tethering to mitochondria and peroxisomes then coordinates MAVS localization to form a signaling synapse between membranes. Importantly, the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease, which cleaves MAVS to support persistent infection, targets this synapse for MAVS proteolysis from the MAM, but not from mitochondria, to ablate RIG-I signaling of immune defenses. Thus, the MAM mediates an intracellular immune synapse that directs antiviral innate immunity.

     US3 PROTEIN KINASE OF HSV-1 CYCLES BETWEEN THE CYTOPLASM AND NUCLEUS AND INTERACTS WITH PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH PROTEIN 4 (PDCD4) TO BLOCK APOPTOSIS [MICROBIOLOGY]
     ........................................
     The US3 protein kinase of herpes simplex virus 1 plays a key role in blocking apoptosis induced by viral gene products or exogenous agents. The US3 protein kinase is similar to protein kinase A with respect to substrate range and specificity. We report that in the yeast two-hybrid system a domain of US3 essential for antiapoptotic activity reacted with programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4). We report that US3 interacts with PDCD4, that PDCD4 is posttranslationally modified in infected cells both in a US3-dependent and -independent fashion, and that depletion of PDCD4 by siRNA blocked apoptosis induced by a Δα4 mutant virus. In infected cells, PDCD4 accumulates in the nucleus, whereas US3 accumulates in the cytoplasm. Studies designed to elucidate the convergence of these proteins led to the discovery that US3 protein kinase cycles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that US3 retains PDCD4 in infected cell nuclei.

     BACTERIAL COMMUNITY COMPARISONS BY TAXONOMY-SUPERVISED ANALYSIS INDEPENDENT OF SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT AND CLUSTERING [MICROBIOLOGY]
     ........................................
     High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes has increased our understanding of microbial community structure, but now even higher-throughput methods to the Illumina scale allow the creation of much larger datasets with more samples and orders-of-magnitude more sequences that swamp current analytic methods. We developed a method capable of handling these larger datasets on the basis of assignment of sequences into an existing taxonomy using a supervised learning approach (taxonomy-supervised analysis). We compared this method with a commonly used clustering approach based on sequence similarity (taxonomy-unsupervised analysis). We sampled 211 different bacterial communities from various habitats and obtained ∼1.3 million 16S rRNA sequences spanning the V4 hypervariable region by pyrosequencing. Both methodologies gave similar ecological conclusions in that β-diversity measures calculated by using these two types of matrices were significantly correlated to each other, as were the ordination configurations and hierarchical clustering dendrograms. In addition, our taxonomy-supervised analyses were also highly correlated with phylogenetic methods, such as UniFrac. The taxonomy-supervised analysis has the advantages that it is not limited by the exhaustive computation required for the alignment and clustering necessary for the taxonomy-unsupervised analysis, is more tolerant of sequencing errors, and allows comparisons when sequences are from different regions of the 16S rRNA gene. With the tremendous expansion in 16S rRNA data acquisition underway, the taxonomy-supervised approach offers the potential to provide more rapid and extensive community comparisons across habitats and samples.

     CONCERTED ACTION OF TWO AVIRULENT SPORE EFFECTORS ACTIVATES REACTION TO PUCCINIA GRAMINIS 1 (RPG1)-MEDIATED CEREAL STEM RUST RESISTANCE [PLANT BIOLOGY]
     ........................................
     The barley stem rust resistance gene Reaction to Puccinia graminis 1 (Rpg1), encoding a receptor-like kinase, confers durable resistance to the stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. The fungal urediniospores form adhesion structures with the leaf epidermal cells within 1 h of inoculation, followed by hyphae and haustorium formation. The RPG1 protein is constitutively expressed and not phosphorylated. On inoculation with avirulent urediniospores, it is phosphorylated in vivo within 5 min and subsequently degraded. Application of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide loops prevented the formation of adhesion structures for spore attachment, the phosphorylation of RPG1, and germination of the viable spores. Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid affinity chromatography of proteins from the ungerminated avirulent rust spores led to the purification and identification of a protein with fibronectin type III and breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein domains and a vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 9 with a coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation domain. Both proteins are required to induce in vivo phosphorylation and degradation of RPG1. Combined application of both proteins caused hypersensitive reaction on the stem rust-resistant cultivar Morex but not on the susceptible cultivar Steptoe. Expression studies indicated that mRNA of both genes are present in ungerminated urediniospores and are constitutively transcribed in sporelings, infected leaves, and haustoria in the investigated avirulent races. Evidence is presented that RPG1, in yeast, interacts with the two protein effectors from the urediniospores that activate cooperatively the stem rust resistance protein RPG1 long before haustoria formation.

     A NOVEL SCREENING SYSTEM IMPROVES GENETIC CORRECTION BY INTERNAL EXON REPLACEMENT
     ........................................
     <p><i>Trans</i>-splicing is a powerful approach to reprogram the genome. It can be used to replace 5', 3' or internal exons. The latter approach has been characterized by low efficiency, as the requirements to promote internal <i>trans</i>-splicing are largely uncharacterized. The <i>trans</i>-splicing process is induced by engineered &lsquo;RNA <i>trans</i>-splicing molecules&rsquo; (RTMs), which target a selected pre-mRNA to be reprogrammed via two complementary binding domains. To facilitate the development of more efficient RTMs for therapeutic applications we constructed a novel fluorescence based screening system. We incorporated exon 52 of the <i>COL17A1</i> gene into a GFP-based cassette system as the target exon. This exon is mutated in many patients with the devastating skin blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa. In a double transfection assay we were able to rapidly identify optimal binding domains targeted to sequences in the surrounding introns 51 and 52. The ability to replace exon 52 was then evaluated in a more endogenous context using a target containing <i>COL17A1</i> exon 51&ndash;intron 51&ndash;exon 52&ndash;intron 52&ndash;exon 53. Two selected RTMs produced significantly higher levels of GFP expression in up to 61% assayed cells. This novel approach allows for rapid identification of efficient RTMs for internal exon replacement.</p>

     INFERRING CAUSATIVE VARIANTS IN MICRORNA TARGET SITES
     ........................................
     <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate genes post transcription by pairing with messenger RNA (mRNA). Variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA regulatory regions might result in altered protein levels and disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim at identifying genomic regions that contain variants associated with disease, but lack tools for finding causative variants. We present a computational tool that can help identifying SNPs associated with diseases, by focusing on SNPs affecting miRNA-regulation of genes. The tool predicts the effects of SNPs in miRNA target sites and uses linkage disequilibrium to map these miRNA-related variants to SNPs of interest in GWAS. We compared our predicted SNP effects in miRNA target sites with measured SNP effects from allelic imbalance sequencing. Our predictions fit measured effects better than effects based on differences in free energy or differences of TargetScan context scores. We also used our tool to analyse data from published breast cancer and Parkinson's disease GWAS and significant trait-associated SNPs from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. A database of predicted SNP effects is available at <a href="http://www.bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/mirsnpscore/">http://www.bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/mirsnpscore/</a>. The database is based on haplotype data from the CEU HapMap population and miRNAs from miRBase 16.0.</p>

     RATIONAL, MODULAR ADAPTATION OF ENZYME-FREE DNA CIRCUITS TO MULTIPLE DETECTION METHODS
     ........................................
     <p>Signal amplification is a key component of molecular detection. Enzyme-free signal amplification is especially appealing for the development of low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics. It has been previously shown that enzyme-free DNA circuits with signal-amplification capacity can be designed using a mechanism called &lsquo;catalyzed hairpin assembly&rsquo;. However, it is unclear whether the efficiency and modularity of such circuits is suitable for multiple analytical applications. We have therefore designed and characterized a simplified DNA circuit based on catalyzed hairpin assembly, and applied it to multiple different analytical formats, including fluorescent, colorimetric, and electrochemical and signaling. By optimizing the design of previous hairpin-based catalytic assemblies we found that our circuit has almost zero background and a high catalytic efficiency, with a <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> value above 1 min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>. The inherent modularity of the circuit allowed us to readily adapt our circuit to detect both RNA and small molecule analytes. Overall, these data demonstrate that catalyzed hairpin assembly is suitable for analyte detection and signal amplification in a &lsquo;plug-and-play&rsquo; fashion.</p>

     EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGIES FOR MICRORNA TARGET IDENTIFICATION
     ........................................
     <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression in most biological processes. They act by guiding the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC) to partially complementary sequences in target mRNAs to suppress gene expression by a combination of translation inhibition and mRNA decay. The commonly accepted mechanism of miRNA targeting in animals involves an interaction between the 5'-end of the miRNA called the &lsquo;seed region&rsquo; and the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the mRNA. Many target prediction algorithms are based around such a model, though increasing evidence demonstrates that targeting can also be mediated through sites other than the 3'-UTR and that seed region base pairing is not always required. The power and validity of such <i>in silico</i> data can be therefore hindered by the simplified rules used to represent targeting interactions. Experimentation is essential to identify genuine miRNA targets, however many experimental modalities exist and their limitations need to be understood. This review summarizes and critiques the existing experimental techniques for miRNA target identification.</p>

     DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS IN THE REGULATION OF OVERLAPPING PROMOTERS
     ........................................
     <p>Optimal response to environmental stimuli often requires activation of certain genes and repression of others. Dual function regulatory proteins play a key role in the differential regulation of gene expression. While repression can be achieved by any DNA binding protein through steric occlusion of RNA polymerase in the promoter region, activation often requires a surface on the regulatory protein to contact RNAP and thus facilitate transcription initiation. RNAP itself is also a DNA binding protein, therefore it can function as a transcriptional repressor. Searching the <i>Escherichia coli</i> promoter database we found that ~14% of the identified &lsquo;forward&rsquo; promoters overlap with a promoter oriented in the opposite direction. In this article we combine a mathematical model with experimental analysis of synthetic regulatory regions to investigate interference of overlapping promoters. We find that promoter interference depends on the characteristics of overlapping promoters. The model predicts that promoter strength and interference can be regulated separately, which provides unique opportunities for regulation. Our experimental data suggest that in principle any DNA binding protein can be used for both activation and repression of promoter transcription, depending on the context. These findings can be exploited in the construction of synthetic networks.</p>

     BLASTR--FAST AND ACCURATE DATABASE SEARCHES FOR NON-CODING RNAS
     ........................................
     <p>We present and validate BlastR, a method for efficiently and accurately searching non-coding RNAs. Our approach relies on the comparison of di-nucleotides using BlosumR, a new log-odd substitution matrix. In order to use BlosumR for comparison, we recoded RNA sequences into protein-like sequences. We then showed that BlosumR can be used along with the BlastP algorithm in order to search non-coding RNA sequences. Using Rfam as a gold standard, we benchmarked this approach and show BlastR to be more sensitive than BlastN. We also show that BlastR is both faster and more sensitive than BlastP used with a single nucleotide log-odd substitution matrix. BlastR, when used in combination with WU-BlastP, is about 5% more accurate than WU-BlastN and about 50 times slower. The approach shown here is equally effective when combined with the NCBI-Blast package. The software is an open source freeware available from <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/rss/www.tcoffee.org/blastr.html">www.tcoffee.org/blastr.html</a>.</p>

     CIS-REGULATION OF MICRORNA EXPRESSION BY SCAFFOLD/MATRIX-ATTACHMENT REGIONS
     ........................................
     <p>microRNAs (miRNAs) spatio-temporally modulate gene expression; however, very little is known about the regulation of their expression. Here, we hypothesized that the well-known <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements of gene expression, scaffold/matrix-attachment regions (MARs) could modulate miRNA expression. Accordingly, we found MARs to be enriched in the upstream regions of miRNA genes. To determine their role in cell type-specific expression of miRNAs, we examined four individual miRNAs (let-7b, miR-17, miR-93 and miR-221) and the miR-17&ndash;92 cluster, known to be overexpressed in neuroblastoma. Our results show that MARs indeed define the cell-specific expression of these miRNAs by tethering the chromatin to nuclear matrix. This is brought about by cell type-specific binding of HMG I/Y protein to MARs that then promotes the local acetylation of histones, serving as boundary elements for gene activation. The binding, chromatin tethering and gene activation by HMG I/Y was not observed in fibroblast control cells but were restricted to neuroblastoma cells. This study implies that the association of MAR binding proteins to MARs could dictate the tissue/context specific regulation of miRNA genes by serving as a boundary element signaling the transcriptional activation.</p>

     GENOME-WIDE EVIDENCE FOR LOCAL DNA METHYLATION SPREADING FROM SMALL RNA-TARGETED SEQUENCES IN ARABIDOPSIS
     ........................................
     <p>Transposable elements (TEs) and their relics play major roles in genome evolution. However, mobilization of TEs is usually deleterious and strongly repressed. In plants and mammals, this repression is typically associated with DNA methylation, but the relationship between this epigenetic mark and TE sequences has not been investigated systematically. Here, we present an improved annotation of TE sequences and use it to analyze genome-wide DNA methylation maps obtained at single-nucleotide resolution in Arabidopsis. We show that although the majority of TE sequences are methylated, ~26% are not. Moreover, a significant fraction of TE sequences densely methylated at CG, CHG and CHH sites (where H = A, T or C) have no or few matching small interfering RNA (siRNAs) and are therefore unlikely to be targeted by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery. We provide evidence that these TE sequences acquire DNA methylation through spreading from adjacent siRNA-targeted regions. Further, we show that although both methylated and unmethylated TE sequences located in euchromatin tend to be more abundant closer to genes, this trend is least pronounced for methylated, siRNA-targeted TE sequences located 5' to genes. Based on these and other findings, we propose that spreading of DNA methylation through promoter regions explains at least in part the negative impact of siRNA-targeted TE sequences on neighboring gene expression.</p>

     THE DISTINCTIVE ROLES OF ERYTHROID SPECIFIC ACTIVATOR GATA-1 AND NF-E2 IN TRANSCRIPTION OF THE HUMAN FETAL {GAMMA}-GLOBIN GENES
     ........................................
     <p>GATA-1 and NF-E2 are erythroid specific activators that bind to the &beta;-globin locus. To explore the roles of these activators in transcription of the human fetal stage specific -globin genes, we reduced GATA-1 and p45/NF-E2 using shRNA in erythroid K562 cells. GATA-1 or p45/NF-E2 knockdown inhibited the transcription of the -globin genes, hypersensitive site (HS) formation in the LCR and chromatin loop formation of the &beta;-globin locus, but histone acetylation across the locus was decreased only in the case of GATA-1 knockdown. In p45/NF-E2 knockdown cells, GATA-1 binding was maintained at the LCR HSs and -globin promoter, but NF-E2 binding at the LCR HSs was reduced by GATA-1 knockdown regardless of the amount of p45/NF-E2 in K562 cells. These results indicate that histone acetylation is dependent on GATA-1 binding, but the binding of GATA-1 is not sufficient for the -globin transcription, HS formation and chromatin loop formation and NF-E2 is required. This idea is supported by the distinctive binding pattern of CBP and Brg1 in the &beta;-globin locus. Furthermore GATA-1-dependent loop formation between HS5 and 3'HS1 suggests correlation between histone modifications and chromatin looping.</p>

     DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATED SPLICE VARIANTS AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY ANALYSIS OF KAPOSI'S SARCOMA-ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS-INFECTED LYMPHATIC ENDOTHELIAL CELLS
     ........................................
     <p>Alternative RNA splicing greatly increases proteome diversity, and the possibility of studying genome-wide alternative splicing (AS) events becomes available with the advent of high-throughput genomics tools devoted to this issue. Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of KS, a tumor of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) lineage, but little is known about the AS variations induced by KSHV. We analyzed KSHV-controlled AS using high-density microarrays capable of detecting all exons in the human genome. Splicing variants and altered exon&ndash;intron usage in infected LEC were found, and these correlated with protein domain modification. The different 3'-UTR used in new transcripts also help isoforms to escape microRNA-mediated surveillance. Exome-level analysis further revealed information that cannot be disclosed using classical gene-level profiling: a significant exon usage difference existed between LEC and CD34<sup>+</sup> precursor cells, and KSHV infection resulted in LEC-to-precursor, dedifferentiation-like exon level reprogramming. Our results demonstrate the application of exon arrays in systems biology research, and suggest the regulatory effects of AS in endothelial cells are far more complex than previously observed. This extra layer of molecular diversity helps to account for various aspects of endothelial biology, KSHV life cycle and disease pathogenesis that until now have been unexplored.</p>

     ROLES OF DNA POLYMERASE I IN LEADING AND LAGGING-STRAND REPLICATION DEFINED BY A HIGH-RESOLUTION MUTATION FOOTPRINT OF COLE1 PLASMID REPLICATION
     ........................................
     <p>DNA polymerase I (pol I) processes RNA primers during lagging-strand synthesis and fills small gaps during DNA repair reactions. However, it is unclear how pol I and pol III work together during replication and repair or how extensive pol I processing of Okazaki fragments is <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we address these questions by analyzing pol I mutations generated through error-prone replication of ColE1 plasmids. The data were obtained by direct sequencing, allowing an accurate determination of the mutation spectrum and distribution. Pol I&rsquo;s mutational footprint suggests: (i) during leading-strand replication pol I is gradually replaced by pol III over at least 1.3 kb; (ii) pol I processing of Okazaki fragments is limited to ~20 nt and (iii) the size of Okazaki fragments is short (~250 nt). While based on ColE1 plasmid replication, our findings are likely relevant to other pol I replicative processes such as chromosomal replication and DNA repair, which differ from ColE1 replication mostly at the recruitment steps. This mutation footprinting approach should help establish the role of other prokaryotic or eukaryotic polymerases <i>in vivo</i>, and provides a tool to investigate how sequence topology, DNA damage, or interactions with protein partners may affect the function of individual DNA polymerases.</p>

     REPLICATION ENHANCER ELEMENTS WITHIN THE OPEN READING FRAME OF TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS AND THEIR EVOLUTION WITHIN THE FLAVIVIRUS GENUS
     ........................................
     <p>We provide experimental evidence of a replication enhancer element (REE) within the capsid gene of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, genus <i>Flavivirus</i>). Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem&ndash;loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.</p>

     ANALYSIS OF GENOMIC VARIATION IN NON-CODING ELEMENTS USING POPULATION-SCALE SEQUENCING DATA FROM THE 1000 GENOMES PROJECT
     ........................................
     <p>In the human genome, it has been estimated that considerably more sequence is under natural selection in non-coding regions [such as transcription-factor binding sites (TF-binding sites) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)] compared to protein-coding ones. However, less attention has been paid to them. To study selective pressure on non-coding elements, we use next-generation sequencing data from the recently completed pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes Project, which, compared to traditional methods, allows for the characterization of a full spectrum of genomic variations, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), short insertions and deletions (indels) and structural variations (SVs). We develop a framework for combining these variation data with non-coding elements, calculating various population-based metrics to compare classes and subclasses of elements, and developing element-aware aggregation procedures to probe the internal structure of an element. Overall, we find that TF-binding sites and ncRNAs are less selectively constrained for SNPs than coding sequences (CDSs), but more constrained than a neutral reference. We also determine that the relative amounts of constraint for the three types of variations are, in general, correlated, but there are some differences: counter-intuitively, TF-binding sites and ncRNAs are more selectively constrained for indels than for SNPs, compared to CDSs. After inspecting the overall properties of a class of elements, we analyze selective pressure on subclasses within an element class, and show that the extent of selection is associated with the genomic properties of each subclass. We find, for instance, that ncRNAs with higher expression levels tend to be under stronger purifying selection, and the actual regions of TF-binding motifs are under stronger selective pressure than the corresponding peak regions. Further, we develop element-aware aggregation plots to analyze selective pressure across the linear structure of an element, with the confidence intervals evaluated using both simple bootstrapping and block bootstrapping techniques. We find, for example, that both micro-RNAs (particularly the seed regions) and their binding targets are under stronger selective pressure for SNPs than their immediate genomic surroundings. In addition, we demonstrate that substitutions in TF-binding motifs inversely correlate with site conservation, and SNPs unfavorable for motifs are under more selective constraints than favorable SNPs. Finally, to further investigate intra-element differences, we show that SVs have the tendency to use distinctive modes and mechanisms when they interact with genomic elements, such as enveloping whole gene(s) rather than disrupting them partially, as well as duplicating TF motifs in tandem.</p>

     IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A NOVEL UBIQUITOUS NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 'NARR' ENCODED BY A GENE OVERLAPPING THE RAB34 ONCOGENE
     ........................................
     <p>There are only few reports on protein products originating from overlapping mammalian genes even though computational predictions suggest that an appreciable fraction of mammalian genes could potentially overlap. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has now acquired the tools to probe proteins in an unbiased manner, providing direct evidence of the output of the genomic and gene expression machinery. In particular, proteomics can refine gene predictions and discover novel gene-processing events and gene arrangements. Here, we report the mass spectrometric discovery and biochemical validation of the novel protein encoded by a gene overlapping <i>rab34</i> oncogene. The novel protein is highly conserved in mammals. In humans, it contains 13 distinct Nine-Amino acid Residue-Repeats (NARR) with the consensus sequence PRVIV(S/T)PR in which the serine or threonine residues are phosphorylated during M-phase. NARR is ubiquitously expressed and resides in nucleoli where it colocalizes with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene clusters. Its distribution only partially overlaps with upstream binding factor, one of the main regulators of RNA Polymerase I activity, and is entirely uncoupled from it in mitotic cells and upon inhibition of transcription. NARR only partially colocalizes with fibrillarin, the pre-ribosomal RNA-processing protein, positioning NARR in a separate niche within the rDNA cluster.</p>

     ADENINE AND GUANINE RECOGNITION OF STOP CODON IS MEDIATED BY DIFFERENT N DOMAIN CONFORMATIONS OF TRANSLATION TERMINATION FACTOR ERF1
     ........................................
     <p>Positioning of release factor eRF1 toward adenines and the ribose-phosphate backbone of the UAAA stop signal in the ribosomal decoding site was studied using messenger RNA (mRNA) analogs containing stop signal UAA/UAAA and a photoactivatable cross-linker at definite locations. The human eRF1 peptides cross-linked to these analogs were identified. Cross-linkers on the adenines at the 2nd, 3rd or 4th position modified eRF1 near the conserved YxCxxxF loop (positions 125&ndash;131 in the N domain), but cross-linker at the 4th position mainly modified the tripeptide 26-AAR-28. This tripeptide cross-linked also with derivatized 3'-phosphate of UAA, while the same cross-linker at the 3'-phosphate of UAAA modified both the 26&ndash;28 and 67&ndash;73 fragments. A comparison of the results with those obtained earlier with mRNA analogs bearing a similar cross-linker at the guanines indicates that positioning of eRF1 toward adenines and guanines of stop signals in the 80S termination complex is different. Molecular modeling of eRF1 in the 80S termination complex showed that eRF1 fragments neighboring guanines and adenines of stop signals are compatible with different N domain conformations of eRF1. These conformations vary by positioning of stop signal purines toward the universally conserved dipeptide 31-GT-32, which neighbors guanines but is oriented more distantly from adenines.</p>

     AVOIDING CYTOTOXICITY OF TRANSPOSASES BY DOSE-CONTROLLED MRNA DELIVERY
     ........................................
     <p>The <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> (SB) transposase and its newly developed hyperactive variant, SB100X, are of increasing interest for genome modification in experimental models and gene therapy. The potential cytotoxicity of transposases requires careful assessment, considering that residual integration events of transposase expression vectors delivered by physicochemical transfection or episomal retroviral vectors may lead to permanent transposase expression and resulting uncontrollable transposition. Comparing retrovirus-based approaches for delivery of mRNA, episomal DNA or integrating DNA, we found that conventional SB transposase, SB100X and a newly developed codon-optimized SB100Xo may trigger premitotic arrest and apoptosis. Cell stress induced by continued SB overexpression was self-limiting due to the induction of cell death, which occurred even in the absence of a co-transfected transposable element. The cytotoxic effects of SB transposase were strictly dose dependent and heralded by induction of p53 and c-Jun. Inactivating mutations in SB&rsquo;s catalytic domain could not abrogate cytotoxicity, suggesting a mechanism independent of DNA cleavage activity. An improved approach of retrovirus particle-mediated mRNA transfer allowed transient and dose-controlled expression of SB100X, supported efficient transposition and prevented cytotoxicity. Transposase-mediated gene transfer can thus be tuned to maintain high efficiency in the absence of overt cell damage.</p>

     PROMOTER UPSTREAM TRANSCRIPTS SHARE CHARACTERISTICS WITH MRNAS AND ARE PRODUCED UPSTREAM OF ALL THREE MAJOR TYPES OF MAMMALIAN PROMOTERS
     ........................................
     <p>PROMoter uPstream Transcripts (PROMPTs) were identified as a new class of human RNAs, which are heterologous in length and produced only upstream of the promoters of active protein-coding genes. Here, we show that PROMPTs carry 3'-adenosine tails and 5'-cap structures. However, unlike mRNAs, PROMPTs are largely nuclear and rapidly turned over by the RNA exosome. PROMPT-transcribing DNA is occupied by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complexes with serine 2 phosphorylated C-terminal domains (CTDs), mimicking that of the associated genic region. Thus, the inefficient elongation capacity of PROMPT transcription cannot solely be assigned to poor CTD phosphorylation. Conditions that reduce gene transcription increase RNAPII occupancy of the upstream PROMPT region, suggesting that they reside in a common transcription compartment. Surprisingly, gene promoters that are actively transcribed by RNAPI or RNAPIII also produce PROMPTs that are targeted by the exosome. RNAPIII PROMPTs bear hallmarks of RNAPII promoter-associated RNAs, explaining the physical presence of RNAPII upstream of many RNAPIII-transcribed genes. We propose that RNAPII activity upstream gene promoters are wide-spread and integral to the act of gene transcription.</p>

     DEPURINATION OF BROME MOSAIC VIRUS RNA3 INHIBITS ITS PACKAGING INTO VIRUS PARTICLES
     ........................................
     <p>Packaging of the segmented RNA genome of Brome mosaic virus (BMV) into discrete particles is an essential step in the virus life cycle; however, questions remain regarding the mechanism of RNA packaging and the degree to which the viral coat protein controls the process. In this study, we used a plant-derived glycosidase, Pokeweed antiviral protein, to remove 14 specific bases from BMV RNA3 to examine the effect of depurination on virus assembly. Depurination of A771 within ORF3 and A1006 in the intergenic region inhibited coat protein binding and prevented RNA3 incorporation into particles. The disruption of interaction was not based on sequence identity, as mutation of these two purines to pyrimidines did not decrease coat protein-binding affinity. Rather, we suggest that base removal results in decreased thermodynamic stability of local RNA structures required for packaging, and that this instability is detected by coat protein. These results describe a new level of discrimination by coat protein, whereby it recognizes damage to specific viral RNA elements in the form of base removal and selects against incorporating the RNA into particles.</p>

     CHARACTERIZATION OF EXTRACELLULAR CIRCULATING MICRORNA
     ........................................
     <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of post-transcriptional gene expression regulators, have recently been detected in human body fluids, including peripheral blood plasma as extracellular nuclease resistant entities. However, the origin and function of extracellular circulating miRNA remain essentially unknown. Here, we confirmed that circulating mature miRNA in contrast to mRNA or snRNA is strikingly stable in blood plasma and cell culture media. Furthermore, we found that most miRNA in plasma and cell culture media completely passed through 0.22 &micro;m filters but remained in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation at 110 000<i>g</i> indicating the non-vesicular origin of the extracellular miRNA. Furthermore, western blot immunoassay revealed that extracellular miRNA ultrafiltrated together with the 96 kDa Ago2 protein, a part of RNA-induced silencing complex. Moreover, miRNAs in both blood plasma and cell culture media co-immunoprecipited with anti-Ago2 antibody in a detergent free environment. This is the first study to show that extracellular miRNAs are predominantly exosomes/microvesicles free and are associated with Ago proteins. We hypothesize that extracellular miRNAs are in the most part by-products of dead cells that remain in extracellular space due to the high stability of the Ago2 protein and Ago2-miRNA complex. Nevertheless, our data does not reject the possibility that some miRNAs can be associated with exosomes.</p>

     THE IN VITRO LOOSE DIMER STRUCTURE AND REARRANGEMENTS OF THE HIV-2 LEADER RNA
     ........................................
     <p>RNA dimerization is an essential step in the retroviral life cycle. Dimerization and encapsidation signals, closely linked in HIV-2, are located in the leader RNA region. The SL1 motif and nucleocapsid protein are considered important for both processes. In this study, we show the structure of the HIV-2 leader RNA (+1&ndash;560) captured as a loose dimer. Potential structural rearrangements within the leader RNA were studied. In the loose dimer form, the HIV-2 leader RNA strand exists <i>in vitro</i> as a single global fold. Two kissing loop interfaces within the loose dimer were identified: SL1/SL1 and TAR/TAR. Evidence for these findings is provided by RNA probing using SHAPE, chemical reagents, enzymes, non-denaturing PAGE mobility assays, antisense oligonucleotides hybridization and analysis of an RNA mutant. Both TAR and SL1 as isolated domains are bound by recombinant NCp8 protein with high affinity, contrary to the hairpins downstream of SL1. Foot-printing of the SL1/NCp8 complex indicates that the major binding site maps to the SL1 upper stem. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which TAR hairpin III, the segment of SL1 proximal to the loop and the PAL palindromic sequence play specific roles in the initiation of dimerization.</p>

     FUNCTIONAL CONSERVATION IN HUMAN AND DROSOPHILA OF METAZOAN ADAR2 INVOLVED IN RNA EDITING: LOSS OF ADAR1 IN INSECTS
     ........................................
     <p>Flies with mutations in the single <i>Drosophila Adar</i> gene encoding an RNA editing enzyme involved in editing 4% of all transcripts have severe locomotion defects and develop age-dependent neurodegeneration. Vertebrates have two ADAR-editing enzymes that are catalytically active; ADAR1 and ADAR2. We show that human <i>ADAR2</i> rescues <i>Drosophila Adar</i> mutant phenotypes. Neither the short nuclear ADAR1p110 isoform nor the longer interferon-inducible cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 isoform rescue walking defects efficiently, nor do they correctly edit specific sites in <i>Drosophila</i> transcripts. Surprisingly, human ADAR1p110 does suppress age-dependent neurodegeneration in <i>Drosophila Adar</i> mutants whereas ADAR1p150 does not. The single <i>Drosophila Adar</i> gene was previously assumed to represent an evolutionary ancestor of the multiple vertebrate ADARs. The strong functional similarity of human ADAR2 and <i>Drosophila Adar</i> suggests rather that these are true orthologs. By a combination of direct cloning and searching new invertebrate genome sequences we show that distinct <i>ADAR1</i> and <i>ADAR2</i> genes were present very early in the Metazoan lineage, both occurring before the split between the Bilateria and Cnidarians. The <i>ADAR1</i> gene has been lost several times, including during the evolution of insects and crustacea. These data complement our rescue results, supporting the idea that ADAR1 and ADAR2 have evolved highly conserved, distinct functions.</p>

     EBP1 AND DRBP76/NF90 BINDING PROTEINS ARE INCLUDED IN THE MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS II RNA OPERON
     ........................................
     <p>Major histocompatibility complex class II mRNAs encode heterodimeric proteins involved in the presentation of exogenous antigens during an immune response. Their 3'UTRs bind a protein complex in which we identified two factors: EBP1, an ErbB3 receptor-binding protein and DRBP76, a double-stranded RNA binding nuclear protein, also known as nuclear factor 90 (NF90). Both are well-characterized regulatory factors of several mRNA molecules processing. Using either EBP1 or DRBP76/NF90-specific knockdown experiments, we established that the two proteins play a role in regulating the expression of HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 mRNAs levels. Our study represents the first indication of the existence of a functional unit that includes different transcripts involved in the adaptive immune response. We propose that the concept of &lsquo;RNA operon&rsquo; may be suitable for our system in which MHCII mRNAs are modulated via interaction of their 3'UTR with same proteins.</p>

     CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF CGG RNA REPEATS WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR FRAGILE X-ASSOCIATED TREMOR ATAXIA SYNDROME
     ........................................
     <p>The CGG repeats are present in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the fragile X mental retardation gene <i>FMR1</i> and are associated with two diseases: fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXTAS occurs when the number of repeats is 55&ndash;200 and FXS develops when the number exceeds 200. FXTAS is an RNA-mediated disease in which the expanded CGG tracts form stable structures and sequester important RNA binding proteins. We obtained and analysed three crystal structures of double-helical CGG repeats involving unmodified and 8-Br modified guanosine residues. Despite the presence of the non-canonical base pairs, the helices retain an A-form. In the G&ndash;G pairs one guanosine is always in the <i>syn</i> conformation, the other is <i>anti</i>. There are two hydrogen bonds between the Watson&ndash;Crick edge of G(<i>anti</i>) and the Hoogsteen edge of G(<i>syn</i>): O6&middot;N1H and N7&middot;N2H. The G(<i>syn</i>)-G(<i>anti</i>) pair shows affinity for binding ions in the major groove. G(<i>syn</i>) causes local unwinding of the helix, compensated elsewhere along the duplex. CGG helical structures appear relatively stable compared with CAG and CUG tracts. This could be an important factor in the RNA&rsquo;s ligand binding affinity and specificity.</p>

     A MULTIFUNCTIONAL BIOCONJUGATE MODULE FOR VERSATILE PHOTOAFFINITY LABELING AND CLICK CHEMISTRY OF RNA
     ........................................
     <p>A multifunctional reagent based on a coumarin scaffold was developed for derivatization of naive RNA. The alkylating agent N3BC [7-azido-4-(bromomethyl)coumarin], obtained by Pechmann condensation, is selective for uridine. N3BC and its RNA conjugates are pre-fluorophores which permits controlled modular and stepwise RNA derivatization. The success of RNA alkylation by N3BC can be monitored by photolysis of the azido moiety, which generates a coumarin fluorophore that can be excited with UV light of 320 nm. The azidocoumarin-modified RNA can be flexibly employed in structure-function studies. Versatile applications include direct use in photo-crosslinking studies to cognate proteins, as demonstrated with tRNA and RNA fragments from the MS2 phage and the HIV genome. Alternatively, the azide function can be used for further derivatization by click-chemistry. This allows e.g. the introduction of an additional fluorophore for excitation with visible light.</p>

     RNASE P: AT LAST, THE KEY FINDS ITS LOCK [PERSPECTIVE]
     ........................................
     <p>Apart from the ribosome, the crystal structure of the bacterial RNase P in complex with a tRNA, reported by Reiter and colleagues recently, constitutes the first example of a multiple turnover RNA enzyme. Except in rare exceptions, RNase P is ubiquitous and, like the ribosome, is older than the initial branch point of the phylogenetic tree. Importantly, the structure shows how the RNA and the protein moieties cooperate to process the pre-tRNA substrates. The catalytic site comprises some critical RNA residues spread over the secondary structure but gathered in a compact volume next to the protein, which helps recognize and orient the substrate. The discussion here outlines some important aspects of that crystal structure, some of which could apply to RNA molecules in general.</p>

     UNRAVELING REGULATION AND NEW COMPONENTS OF HUMAN P-BODIES THROUGH A PROTEIN INTERACTION FRAMEWORK AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION [PERSPECTIVE]
     ........................................
     <p>The cellular factors involved in mRNA degradation and translation repression can aggregate into cytoplasmic domains known as GW bodies or mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies). However, current understanding of P-bodies, especially the regulatory aspect, remains relatively fragmentary. To provide a framework for studying the mechanisms and regulation of P-body formation, maintenance, and disassembly, we compiled a list of P-body proteins found in various species and further grouped both reported and predicted human P-body proteins according to their functions. By analyzing protein&ndash;protein interactions of human P-body components, we found that many P-body proteins form complex interaction networks with each other and with other cellular proteins that are not recognized as P-body components. The observation suggests that these other cellular proteins may play important roles in regulating P-body dynamics and functions. We further used siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and immunofluorescence microscopy to demonstrate the validity of our in silico analyses. Our combined approach identifies new P-body components and suggests that protein ubiquitination and protein phosphorylation involving 14-3-3 proteins may play critical roles for post-translational modifications of P-body components in regulating P-body dynamics. Our analyses provide not only a global view of human P-body components and their physical interactions but also a wealth of hypotheses to help guide future research on the regulation and function of human P-bodies.</p>

     ASSESSING COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE DISCOVERY OF SMALL RNA GENES IN BACTERIA [BIOINFORMATICS]
     ........................................
     <p>Over the past decade, a number of biocomputational tools have been developed to predict small RNA (sRNA) genes in bacterial genomes. In this study, several of the leading biocomputational tools, which use different methodologies, were investigated. The performance of the tools, both individually and in combination, was evaluated on ten sets of benchmark data, including data from a novel RNA-seq experiment conducted in this study. The results of this study offer insight into the utility as well as the limitations of the leading biocomputational tools for sRNA identification and provide practical guidance for users of the tools.</p>

     DEFINING THE MER1 AND NAM8 MEIOTIC SPLICING REGULONS BY CDNA RESCUE [REPORT]
     ........................................
     <p>Meiosis-specific pre-mRNA splicing in budding yeast embraces multiple pre-mRNA targets grouped into regulons defined by their genetic requirements for vegetatively optional splicing factors (e.g., splicing enhancer Mer1 and the U1 snRNP subunit Nam8) or snRNA modifications (trimethylguanosine caps). Here, we genetically demarcate a complete meiotic splicing regulon by the criterion of cDNA bypass of the requirement for the governing splicing regulators to execute sporulation. We thereby show that the Mer1 and Nam8 regulons embrace four essential pre-mRNAs: <i>MER2</i>, <i>MER3</i>, <i>SPO22</i>, and <i>AMA1</i>. Whereas Nam8 also regulates <i>PCH2</i> splicing, <i>PCH2</i> cDNA is not needed for sporulation by <i>nam8</i> diploids. Our results show that there are no essential intron-containing RNAs missing from the known roster of Mer1 and Nam8 targets. Nam8 is composed of three RRM domains, flanked by N-terminal leader and C-terminal tail segments. We find that the RRM2 and RRM3 domains, and their putative RNA-binding sites, are essential for yeast sporulation, whereas the leader, tail, and RRM1 modules are not.</p>

     STRUCTURAL BASIS FOR THE DUAL U4 AND U4ATAC SNRNA-BINDING SPECIFICITY OF SPLICEOSOMAL PROTEIN HPRP31 [REPORT]
     ........................................
     <p>Human proteins 15.5K and hPrp31 are components of the major spliceosomal U4 snRNP and of the minor spliceosomal U4atac snRNP. The two proteins bind to related 5'-stem loops (5'SLs) of the U4 and U4atac snRNAs in a strictly sequential fashion. The primary binding 15.5K protein binds at K-turns that exhibit identical sequences in the two snRNAs. However, RNA sequences contacted by the secondary binding hPrp31 differ in U4 and U4atac snRNAs, and the mechanism by which hPrp31 achieves its dual specificity is presently unknown. We show by crystal structure analysis that the capping pentaloops of the U4 and U4atac 5'SLs adopt different structures in the ternary hPrp31&ndash;15.5K&ndash;snRNA complexes. In U4atac snRNA, a noncanonical base pair forms across the pentaloop, based on which the RNA establishes more intimate interactions with hPrp31 compared with U4 snRNA. Stacking of hPrp31&ndash;His270 on the noncanonical base pair at the base of the U4atac pentaloop recapitulates intramolecular stabilizing principles known from the UUCG and GNRA families of RNA tetraloops. Rational mutagenesis corroborated the importance of the noncanonical base pair and the U4atac-specific hPrp31&ndash;RNA interactions for complex stability. The more extensive hPrp31&ndash;U4atac snRNA interactions are in line with a higher stability of the U4atac compared with the U4-based ternary complex seen in gel-shift assays, which may explain how U4atac snRNA can compete with the more abundant U4 snRNA for the same protein partners in vivo.</p>

     NMR STRUCTURE OF A 4 X 4 NUCLEOTIDE RNA INTERNAL LOOP FROM AN R2 RETROTRANSPOSON: IDENTIFICATION OF A THREE PURINE-PURINE SHEARED PAIR MOTIF AND COMPARISON TO MC-SYM PREDICTIONS [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>The NMR solution structure is reported of a duplex, 5'GUGAAGCCCGU/3'UCACAGGAGGC, containing a 4 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 4 nucleotide internal loop from an R2 retrotransposon RNA. The loop contains three sheared purine&ndash;purine pairs and reveals a structural element found in other RNAs, which we refer to as the 3RRs motif. Optical melting measurements of the thermodynamics of the duplex indicate that the internal loop is 1.6 kcal/mol more stable at 37&deg;C than predicted. The results identify the 3RRs motif as a common structural element that can facilitate prediction of 3D structure. Known examples include internal loops having the pairings: 5'GAA/3'AGG, 5'GAG/3'AGG, 5'GAA/3'AAG, and 5'AAG/3'AGG. The structural information is compared with predictions made with the MC-Sym program.</p>

     YRDC EXHIBITS PROPERTIES EXPECTED OF A SUBUNIT FOR A TRNA THREONYLCARBAMOYL TRANSFERASE [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>The post-transcriptional nucleoside modifications of tRNA's anticodon domain form the loop structure and dynamics required for effective and accurate recognition of synonymous codons. The <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification at position 37 (t<sup>6</sup>A<sub>37</sub>), 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, of many tRNA species in all organisms ensures the accurate recognition of ANN codons by increasing codon affinity, enhancing ribosome binding, and maintaining the reading frame. However, biosynthesis of this complex modification is only partially understood. The synthesis requires ATP, free threonine, a single carbon source for the carbamoyl, and an enzyme yet to be identified. Recently, the universal protein family Sua5/YciO/YrdC was associated with t<sup>6</sup>A<sub>37</sub> biosynthesis. To further investigate the role of YrdC in t<sup>6</sup>A<sub>37</sub> biosynthesis, the interaction of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> YrdC with a heptadecamer anticodon stem and loop of lysine tRNA (ASL<sup>Lys</sup><sub>UUU</sub>) was examined. YrdC bound the unmodified ASL<sup>Lys</sup><sub>UUU</sub> with high affinity compared with the t<sup>6</sup>A<sub>37</sub>-modified ASL<sup>Lys</sup><sub>UUU</sub> (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.27 &plusmn; 0.20 &micro;M and 1.36 &plusmn; 0.39 &micro;M, respectively). YrdC also demonstrated specificity toward the unmodified versus modified anticodon pentamer UUUUA and toward threonine and ATP. The protein did not significantly alter the ASL architecture, nor was it able to base flip A<sub>37</sub>, as determined by NMR, circular dichroism, and fluorescence of 2-aminopuine at position 37. Thus, current data support the hypothesis that YrdC, with many of the properties of a putative threonylcarbamoyl transferase, most likely functions as a component of a heteromultimeric protein complex for t<sup>6</sup>A<sub>37</sub> biosynthesis.</p>

     CORRELATING SHAPE SIGNATURES WITH THREE-DIMENSIONAL RNA STRUCTURES [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) is a facile technique for quantitative analysis of RNA secondary structure. In general, low SHAPE signal values indicate Watson-Crick base-pairing, and high values indicate positions that are single-stranded within the RNA structure. However, the relationship of SHAPE signals to structural properties such as non-Watson-Crick base-pairing or stacking has thus far not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we present results of SHAPE experiments performed on several RNAs with published three-dimensional structures. This strategy allows us to analyze the results in terms of correlations between chemical reactivities and structural properties of the respective nucleotide, such as different types of base-pairing, stacking, and phosphate&ndash;backbone interactions. We find that the RNA SHAPE signal is strongly correlated with <i>cis</i>-Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick base-pairing and is to a remarkable degree not dependent on other structural properties with the exception of stacking. We subsequently generated probabilistic models that estimate the likelihood that a residue with a given SHAPE score participates in base-pairing. We show that several models that take SHAPE scores of adjacent residues into account perform better in predicting base-pairing compared with individual SHAPE scores. This underscores the context sensitivity of SHAPE and provides a framework for an improved interpretation of the response of RNA to chemical modification.</p>

     RNA-LIGASE-DEPENDENT BIASES IN MIRNA REPRESENTATION IN DEEP-SEQUENCED SMALL RNA CDNA LIBRARIES [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>Sequencing of small RNA cDNA libraries is an important tool for the discovery of new RNAs and the analysis of their mutational status as well as expression changes across samples. It requires multiple enzyme-catalyzed steps, including sequential oligonucleotide adapter ligations to the 3' and 5' ends of the small RNAs, reverse transcription (RT), and PCR. We assessed biases in representation of miRNAs relative to their input concentration, using a pool of 770 synthetic miRNAs and 45 calibrator oligoribonucleotides, and tested the influence of Rnl1 and two variants of Rnl2, Rnl2(1&ndash;249) and Rnl2(1&ndash;249)K227Q, for 3'-adapter ligation. The use of the Rnl2 variants for adapter ligations yielded substantially fewer side products compared with Rnl1; however, the benefits of using Rnl2 remained largely obscured by additional biases in the 5'-adapter ligation step; RT and PCR steps did not have a significant impact on read frequencies. Intramolecular secondary structures of miRNA and/or miRNA/3'-adapter products contributed to these biases, which were highly reproducible under defined experimental conditions. We used the synthetic miRNA cocktail to derive correction factors for approximation of the absolute levels of individual miRNAs in biological samples. Finally, we evaluated the influence of 5'-terminal 5-nt barcode extensions for a set of 20 barcoded 3' adapters and observed similar biases in miRNA read distribution, thereby enabling cost-saving multiplex analysis for large-scale miRNA profiling.</p>

     RIBOSOMAL PROTEINS' ASSOCIATION WITH TRANSCRIPTION SITES PEAKS AT TRNA GENES IN SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES POMBE [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are essential components of ribosomes, but several RPs are also present at transcription sites of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here, we report a genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analysis of the association of three representative 60S RPs with sites in the <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> chromosomes. All three proteins tend to bind at the same subset of coding and noncoding loci. The data demonstrate selective RNA-dependent interactions between RPs and many transcription sites and suggest that the RPs bind as components of a preassembled multiprotein complex, perhaps 60S or pre-60S subunits. These findings further indicate that the presence of RPs complexes at transcription sites might be a general feature of eukaryotic cells and functionally important. Unexpectedly, the RPs' chromosomal association is highest at centromeres and tRNA genes&mdash;the RPs were found at 167 of the 171 tRNA genes assayed. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that RP complexes are involved in tRNA biogenesis and possibly centromere functions.</p>

     THE ROLE OF SMPB AND THE RIBOSOMAL DECODING CENTER IN LICENSING TMRNA ENTRY INTO STALLED RIBOSOMES [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>In bacteria, stalled ribosomes are recycled by a hybrid transfer&ndash;messenger RNA (tmRNA). Like tRNA, tmRNA is aminoacylated with alanine and is delivered to the ribosome by EF-Tu, where it reacts with the growing polypeptide chain. tmRNA entry into stalled ribosomes poses a challenge to our understanding of ribosome function because it occurs in the absence of a codon&ndash;anticodon interaction. Instead, tmRNA entry is licensed by the binding of its protein partner, SmpB, to the ribosomal decoding center. We analyzed a series of SmpB mutants and found that its C-terminal tail is essential for tmRNA accommodation but not for EF-Tu activation. We obtained evidence that the tail likely functions as a helix on the ribosome to promote accommodation and identified key residues in the tail essential for this step. In addition, our mutational analysis points to a role for the conserved K<sub>131</sub>GKK tail residues in <i>trans</i>-translation after peptidyl transfer to tmRNA, presumably EF-G-mediated translocation or translation of the tmRNA template. Surprisingly, analysis of A1492, A1493, and G530 mutants reveals that while these ribosomal nucleotides are essential for normal tRNA selection, they play little to no role in peptidyl transfer to tmRNA. These studies clarify how SmpB interacts with the ribosomal decoding center to license tmRNA entry into stalled ribosomes.</p>

     PAPD5, A NONCANONICAL POLY(A) POLYMERASE WITH AN UNUSUAL RNA-BINDING MOTIF [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>PAPD5 is one of the seven members of the family of noncanonical poly(A) polymerases in human cells. PAPD5 was shown to polyadenylate aberrant pre-ribosomal RNAs in vivo, similar to degradation-mediating polyadenylation by the noncanonical poly(A) polymerase Trf4p in yeast. PAPD5 has been reported to be also involved in the uridylation-dependent degradation of histone mRNAs. To test whether PAPD5 indeed catalyzes adenylation as well as uridylation of RNA substrates, we analyzed the in vitro properties of recombinant PAPD5 expressed in mammalian cells as well as in bacteria. Our results show that PAPD5 catalyzes the polyadenylation of different types of RNA substrates in vitro. Interestingly, PAPD5 is active without a protein cofactor, whereas its yeast homolog Trf4p is the catalytic subunit of a bipartite poly(A) polymerase in which a separate RNA-binding subunit is needed for activity. In contrast to the yeast protein, the C terminus of PAPD5 contains a stretch of basic amino acids that is involved in binding the RNA substrate.</p>

     A CONSERVED RNA PSEUDOKNOT IN A PUTATIVE MOLECULAR SWITCH DOMAIN OF THE 3'-UNTRANSLATED REGION OF CORONAVIRUSES IS ONLY MARGINALLY STABLE [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>The 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the group 2 coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome contains a predicted bulged stem&ndash;loop (designated P0ab), a conserved <i>cis</i>-acting pseudoknot (PK), and a more distal stem&ndash;loop (designated P2). Base-pairing to create the pseudoknot-forming stem (P1<sup>pk</sup>) is mutually exclusive with formation of stem P0a at the base of the bulged stem&ndash;loop; as a result, the two structures cannot be present simultaneously. Herein, we use thermodynamic methods to evaluate the ability of individual subdomains of the 3' UTR to adopt a pseudoknotted conformation. We find that an RNA capable of forming only the predicted PK (58 nt; 3' nucleotides 241&ndash;185) adopts the P2 stem&ndash;loop with little evidence for P1<sup>pk</sup> pairing in 0.1 M KCl and the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>; as Mg<sup>2+</sup> or 1 M KCl is added, a new thermal unfolding transition is induced and assignable to P1<sup>pk</sup> pairing. The P1<sup>pk</sup> helix is only marginally stable, <i>G</i><sub>25</sub>  1.2 &plusmn; 0.3 kcal/mol (5.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>), and unfolded at 37&deg;C. Similar findings characterize an RNA 5' extended through the P0b helix only (89 nt; 294&ndash;185). In contrast, an RNA capable of forming either the P0a helix or the pseudoknot (97 nt; 301&ndash;185) forms no P1<sup>pk</sup> helix. Thermal unfolding simulations are fully consistent with these experimental findings. These data reveal that the PK forms weakly and only when the competing double-hairpin structure cannot form; in the UTR RNA, the double hairpin is the predominant conformer under all solution conditions.</p>

     THE INTRON OF TRNA-TRPCCA IS DISPENSABLE FOR GROWTH AND TRANSLATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE [ARTICLE]
     ........................................
     <p>A part of eukaryotic tRNA genes harbor an intron at one nucleotide 3' to the anticodon, so that removal of the intron is an essential processing step for tRNA maturation. While some tRNA introns have important roles in modification of certain nucleotides, essentiality of the tRNA intron in eukaryotes has not been tested extensively. This is partly because most of the eukaryotic genomes have multiple genes encoding an isoacceptor tRNA. Here, we examined whether the intron of tRNA-Trp<sub>CCA</sub> genes, six copies of which are scattered on the genome of yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is essential for growth or translation of the yeast in vivo. We devised a procedure to remove all of the tRNA introns from the yeast genome iteratively with marker cassettes containing both positive and negative markers. Using this procedure, we removed all the introns from the six tRNA-Trp<sub>CCA</sub> genes, and found that the intronless strain grew normally and expressed tRNA-Trp<sub>CCA</sub> in an amount similar to that of the wild-type genes. Neither incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled amino acids into a TCA-insoluble fraction nor the major protein pattern on SDS-PAGE/2D gel were affected by complete removal of the intron, while expression levels of some proteins were marginally affected. Therefore, the tRNA-Trp<sub>CCA</sub> intron is dispensable for growth and bulk translation of the yeast. This raises the possibility that some mechanism other than selective pressure from translational efficiency maintains the tRNA intron on the yeast genome.</p>

     A LASSO REGRESSION MODEL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF MICRORNA-TARGET REGULATORY NETWORKS
     ........................................
     <p><b>Motivation:</b> MicroRNAs have recently emerged as a major class of regulatory molecules involved in a broad range of biological processes and complex diseases. Construction of miRNA-target regulatory networks can provide useful information for the study and diagnosis of complex diseases. Many sequence-based and evolutionary information-based methods have been developed to identify miRNA&ndash;mRNA targeting relationships. However, as the amount of available miRNA and gene expression data grows, a more statistical and systematic method combining sequence-based binding predictions and expression-based correlation data becomes necessary for the accurate identification of miRNA&ndash;mRNA pairs.</p>
<p><b>Results:</b> We propose a Lasso regression model for the identification of miRNA&ndash;mRNA targeting relationships that combines sequence-based prediction information, miRNA co-regulation, RISC availability and miRNA/mRNA abundance data. By comparing this modelling approach with two other known methods applied to three different datasets, we found that the Lasso regression model has considerable advantages in both sensitivity and specificity. The regression coefficients in the model can be used to determine the true regulatory efficacies in tissues and was demonstrated using the miRNA target site type data. Finally, by constructing the miRNA regulatory networks in two stages of prostate cancer (PCa), we found the several significant miRNA-hubbed network modules associated with PCa metastasis. In conclusion, the Lasso regression model is a robust and informative tool for constructing the miRNA regulatory networks for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.</p>

     ANALYSES OF THE FUNCTIONAL REGIONS OF DEAD-BOX RNA "HELICASES" WITH DELETION AND CHIMERA CONSTRUCTS TESTED IN VIVO AND IN VITRO.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 23 PMID: 21884706<br />Authors: Banroques, J. - Cordin, O. - Doere, M. - Linder, P. - Tanner, N. K.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />The DEAD-box family of putative RNA helicases is composed of ubiquitous proteins that are found in nearly all organisms and that are involved in virtually all processes involving RNA. They are characterized by two tandemly linked, RecA-like domains that contain 11 conserved motifs and highly variable amino- and carboxy-terminal flanking sequences. For this reason, they are often considered to be modular multi-domain proteins. We tested this by making extensive BLASTs and sequence alignments to elucidate the minimal functional unit in nature. We then used this information to construct chimeras and deletions of six essential yeast proteins that were assayed in vivo. We purified many of the different constructs and characterized their biochemical properties in vitro. We found that sequence elements can only be switched between closely related proteins and that the carboxy-terminal sequences are important for high ATPase and strand displacement activities and for high RNA binding affinity. The amino-terminal elements were often toxic when overexpressed in vivo, and they may play regulatory roles. Both the amino and the carboxyl regions have a high frequency of sequences that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, indicating that the flanking regions do not form distinct modular domains but probably assume an ordered structure with ligand binding. Finally, the minimal functional unit of the DEAD-box core starts two amino acids before the isolated phenylalanine of the Q motif and extends to about 35 residues beyond motif VI. These experiments provide evidence for how a highly conserved structural domain can be adapted to different cellular needs.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21884706&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     ARCHAEAL TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR AIF2 CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR EUKARYOTIC EIF2 IN RIBOSOMAL SCANNING DURING MAMMALIAN 48S COMPLEX FORMATION.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 23 PMID: 21884705<br />Authors: Dmitriev, S. E. - Stolboushkina, E. A. - Terenin, I. M. - Andreev, D. E. - Garber, M. B. - Shatsky, I. N.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Heterotrimeric translation initiation factor (IF) a/eIF2 (archaeal/eukaryotic IF 2) is present in both Eukarya and Archaea. Despite strong structural similarity between a/eIF2 orthologs from the two domains of life, their functional relationship is obscure. Here, we show that aIF2 from Sulfolobus solfataricus can substitute for its mammalian counterpart in the reconstitution of eukaryotic 48S initiation complexes from purified components. aIF2 is able to correctly place the initiator Met-tRNA(i) into the P-site of the 40S ribosomal subunit and accompany the entire set of eukaryotic translation IFs in the process of cap-dependent scanning and AUG codon selection. However, it seems to be unable to participate in the following step of ribosomal subunit joining. In accordance with this, aIF2 inhibits rather than stimulates protein synthesis in mammalian cell-free system. The ability of recombinant aIF2 protein to direct ribosomal scanning suggests that some archaeal mRNAs may utilize this mechanism during translation initiation.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21884705&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     RNA INTERFERENCE AS A TOOL FOR EXPLORING HIV-1 ROBUSTNESS.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 22 PMID: 21875599<br />Authors: Nevot, M. - Martrus, G. - Clotet, B. - Martinez, M. A.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target viral genes can efficiently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Nevertheless, there is the potential for viral escape, particularly with a highly mutable target such as HIV-1. We present a novel strategy for anticipating and preventing viral escape using second-generation siRNAs. The evolutionary capacity of HIV-1 was tested by exerting strong selective pressure on a highly conserved sequence in the HIV-1 genome. We assayed the antiviral efficacy of five overlapping siRNAs directed against an essential region of the HIV-1 protease. Serial viral transfers in U87-CD4-CXCR4 cells were performed using four of the siRNAs. This procedure was repeated until virus breakthrough was detected. After several serial culture passages, resistant virus with a single point mutation in the targeted region was detected in the culture supernatants. The emergence of resistant virus was confirmed by molecular cloning and DNA sequencing of viral RNA. The most common escape route was the D30N mutation. Importantly, the addition of a second-generation siRNA that matched the D30N mutation restored viral inhibition and delayed development of escape variants. Passages performed with both siRNAs prevented the emergence of the D30N escape mutant and forced the virus to develop new escape routes. Thus, second-generation siRNAs can be used to block escape from RNA interference (RNAi) and to search for new RNAi escape routes. The protocol described here may be useful for exploring the sequence space available for HIV-1 evolution and for producing attenuated or deleterious viruses.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21875599&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     COMPLETE MODIFICATION MAPS FOR THE CYTOSOLIC SMALL AND LARGE SUBUNIT RRNAS OF EUGLENA GRACILIS: FUNCTIONAL AND EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF CONTRASTING PATTERNS BETWEEN THE TWO RRNA COMPONENTS.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 22 PMID: 21875598<br />Authors: Schnare, M. N. - Gray, M. W.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />In the protist Euglena gracilis, the cytosolic small subunit (SSU) rRNA is a single, covalently continuous species typical of most eukaryotes; in contrast, the large subunit (LSU) rRNA is naturally fragmented, comprising 14 separate RNA molecules instead of the bipartite (28S+5.8S) eukaryotic LSU rRNA typically seen. We present extensively revised secondary structure models of the E. gracilis SSU and LSU rRNAs and have mapped the positions of all of the modified nucleosides in these rRNAs (88 SSU rRNAs and 262 LSU rRNAs, with only 3 LSU modifications incompletely characterized). The relative proportions of ribose-methylated nucleoside and pseudouridine ( approximately 60% and approximately 35%, respectively) are closely similar in the two rRNAs; however, whereas the Euglena SSU rRNA has about the same absolute number of modifications as its human counterpart, the Euglena LSU rRNA has twice as many modifications as the corresponding human LSU rRNA. The increased levels of rRNA fragmentation and modification in E. gracilis LSU rRNA are correlated with a 3-fold increase in the level of mispairing in helical regions compared to the human LSU rRNA. In contrast, no comparable increase in mispairing is seen in helical regions of the SSU rRNA compared to its homologs in other eukaryotes. In view of the reported effects of both ribose-methylated nucleoside and pseudouridine residues on RNA structure, these correlations lead us to suggest that increased modification in the LSU rRNA may play a role in stabilizing a 'looser' structure promoted by elevated helical mispairing and a high degree of fragmentation.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21875598&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF THE ROTAVIRUS NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEIN NSP5.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 10 PMID: 21864538<br />Authors: Martin, D. - Ouldali, M. - Menetrey, J. - Poncet, D.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Rotavirus is one of the leading agents of gastroenteritis worldwide. During infection, viral factories (viroplasms) are formed. The rotavirus nonstructural proteins NSP5 and NSP2 are the major building blocks of viroplasms; however, NSP5 function and organisation remain elusive. In this report, we present a structural characterisation of NSP5. Multi-angle laser light scattering, sedimentation velocity and equilibrium sedimentation experiments demonstrate that recombinant full-length NSP5 forms a decamer in solution. Far-Western, pull-down and multi-angle laser light scattering experiments show that NSP5 has two oligomerisation regions. The first region, residues 103-146, is involved in NSP5 dimerisation, whereas the second region, residues 189-198, is responsible for NSP5 decamerisation. Circular dichroism analyses of full-length and truncated forms of NSP5 reveal that the decamerisation region is helical, whereas the dimerisation region involves beta-sheets. From these circular dichroism experiments, we also show that the NSP5 protomers contain two alpha-helices, a disordered N-terminal half and a C-terminal half that is primarily composed of beta-sheet folds. This extensive structural characterisation of NSP5 led us to propose a model for its quaternary organisation. Finally, co-expression of NSP5 fragments and NSP2 in uninfected cells shows that the NSP5 decamerisation region is required for viroplasm-like structure formation. However, in vitro, the NSP5 decamerisation region partially inhibits the NSP2-NSP5 interaction. Our NSP5 model suggests that steric hindrance prevents NSP2 from binding to all NSP5 protomers. Some protomers may thus be free to interact with other NSP5 binding partners, such as viral RNAs and the viral polymerase VP1, to perform functions other than viroplasm organisation.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21864538&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     INDIRECT REPRESSION BY BACILLUSSUBTILIS CODY VIA DISPLACEMENT OF THE ACTIVATOR OF THE PROLINE UTILIZATION OPERON.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 5 PMID: 21840319<br />Authors: Belitsky, B. R.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Proline is an efficient source of both carbon and nitrogen for many bacterial species. In Bacillus subtilis, the proline utilization pathway, encoded by the putBCP operon, is inducible by proline. Here, we show that this induction is mediated by PutR, a proline-responsive transcriptional activator of the PucR family. When other amino acids are present in the medium, proline utilization is prioritized through transient repression by CodY, a global transcriptional regulator in Gram-positive bacteria that responds to amino acid availability. CodY-mediated repression of the putBCP operon has two novel features. First, repression requires the cooperative binding of CodY to at least two adjacent motifs. Second, though CodY binds to the region that overlaps the putB promoter, repression is due to displacement of PutR rather than competition with RNA polymerase.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21840319&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     DUPLEX UNWINDING AND ATPASE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEAD-BOX HELICASE EIF4A ARE COUPLED BY EIF4G AND EIF4B.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 5 PMID: 21840318<br />Authors: Ozes, A. R. - Feoktistova, K. - Avanzino, B. C. - Fraser, C. S.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A is a DEAD-box helicase that stimulates translation initiation by unwinding mRNA secondary structure. The accessory proteins eIF4G, eIF4B, and eIF4H enhance the duplex unwinding activity of eIF4A, but the extent to which they modulate eIF4A activity is poorly understood. Here, we use real-time fluorescence assays to determine the kinetic parameters of duplex unwinding and ATP hydrolysis by these initiation factors. To ensure efficient duplex unwinding, eIF4B and eIF4G cooperatively activate the duplex unwinding activity of eIF4A. Our data reveal that eIF4H is much less efficient at stimulating eIF4A unwinding activity than eIF4B, implying that eIF4H is not able to completely substitute for eIF4B in duplex unwinding. By monitoring unwinding and ATPase assays under identical conditions, we demonstrate that eIF4B couples the ATP hydrolysis cycle of eIF4A with strand separation, thereby minimizing nonproductive unwinding events. Using duplex substrates with altered GC contents but similar predicted thermal stabilities, we further show that the rate of formation of productive unwinding complexes is strongly influenced by the local stability per base pair, in addition to the stability of the entire duplex. This finding explains how a change in the GC content of a hairpin is able to influence translation initiation while maintaining the overall predicted thermal stability.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21840318&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     THE STRUCTURE OF CDK8/CYCC IMPLICATES SPECIFICITY IN THE CDK/CYCLIN FAMILY AND REVEALS INTERACTION WITH A DEEP POCKET BINDER.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Sep 16 PMID: 21806996<br />Authors: Schneider, E. V. - Bottcher, J. - Blaesse, M. - Neumann, L. - Huber, R. - Maskos, K.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 8 associates with cyclin C (CycC) and belongs to the CDK module of the Mediator of transcription, together with MED12 and MED13. CDK8 is involved in the regulation of mRNA transcription and was identified as a potent oncogene in colon cancerogenesis. We have solved the 2.2-A crystal structure of CDK8/CycC in complex with sorafenib, an anti-cancer drug of clinical relevance. The CDK8 structure reveals a unique CycC recognition helix that explains the specificity of the CDK8/CycC pair and discrimination among the highly promiscuous binding in the CDK/cyclin family. In contrast to all CDKs, the CDK8 activation loop appears not to be phosphorylated. Based on the structure, we discuss an alternate mode of CDK8 activation to the general CDK activation by T-loop phosphorylation. Sorafenib binds to the catalytic cleft of CDK8. It displays a deep pocket binding mode and is the first small molecule to induce a DFG-out conformation in the CDK family, which is actually DMG-out in CDK8.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21806996&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     CONFORMATION EFFECTS OF BASE MODIFICATION ON THE ANTICODON STEM-LOOP OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS TRNA(TYR).
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Sep 16 PMID: 21782828<br />Authors: Denmon, A. P. - Wang, J. - Nikonowicz, E. P.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />tRNA molecules contain 93 chemically unique nucleotide base modifications that expand the chemical and biophysical diversity of RNA and contribute to the overall fitness of the cell. Nucleotide modifications of tRNA confer fidelity and efficiency to translation and are important in tRNA-dependent RNA-mediated regulatory processes. The three-dimensional structure of the anticodon is crucial to tRNA-mRNA specificity, and the diverse modifications of nucleotide bases in the anticodon region modulate this specificity. We have determined the solution structures and thermodynamic properties of Bacillus subtilis tRNA(Tyr) anticodon arms containing the natural base modifications N(6)-dimethylallyl adenine (i(6)A(37)) and pseudouridine (psi(39)). UV melting and differential scanning calorimetry indicate that the modifications stabilize the stem and may enhance base stacking in the loop. The i(6)A(37) modification disrupts the hydrogen bond network of the unmodified anticodon loop including a C(32)-A(38)(+) base pair and an A(37)-U(33) base-base interaction. Although the i(6)A(37) modification increases the dynamic nature of the loop nucleotides, metal ion coordination reestablishes conformational homogeneity. Interestingly, the i(6)A(37) modification and Mg(2+) are sufficient to promote the U-turn fold of the anticodon loop of Escherichia coli tRNA(Phe), but these elements do not result in this signature feature of the anticodon loop in tRNA(Tyr).<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21782828&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ENDORIBONUCLEASE ACTIVE SITE OF HUMAN APURINIC/APYRIMIDINIC ENDONUCLEASE 1.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Sep 2 PMID: 21762700<br />Authors: Kim, W. C. - Berquist, B. R. - Chohan, M. - Uy, C. - Wilson, D. M. 3rd - Lee, C. H.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is the major mammalian enzyme in DNA base excision repair that cleaves the DNA phosphodiester backbone immediately 5' to abasic sites. Recently, we identified APE1 as an endoribonuclease that cleaves a specific coding region of c-myc mRNA in vitro, regulating c-myc mRNA level and half-life in cells. Here, we further characterized the endoribonuclease activity of APE1, focusing on the active-site center of the enzyme previously defined for DNA nuclease activities. We found that most site-directed APE1 mutant proteins (N68A, D70A, Y171F, D210N, F266A, D308A, and H309S), which target amino acid residues constituting the abasic DNA endonuclease active-site pocket, showed significant decreases in endoribonuclease activity. Intriguingly, the D283N APE1 mutant protein retained endoribonuclease and abasic single-stranded RNA cleavage activities, with concurrent loss of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site cleavage activities on double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The mutant proteins bound c-myc RNA equally well as wild-type (WT) APE1, with the exception of H309N, suggesting that most of these residues contributed primarily to RNA catalysis and not to RNA binding. Interestingly, both the endoribonuclease and the ssRNA AP site cleavage activities of WT APE1 were present in the absence of Mg(2+), while ssDNA AP site cleavage required Mg(2+) (optimally at 0.5-2.0 mM). We also found that a 2'-OH on the sugar moiety was absolutely required for RNA cleavage by WT APE1, consistent with APE1 leaving a 3'-PO(4)(2-) group following cleavage of RNA. Altogether, our data support the notion that a common active site is shared for the endoribonuclease and other nuclease activities of APE1; however, we provide evidence that the mechanisms for cleaving RNA, abasic single-stranded RNA, and abasic DNA by APE1 are not identical, an observation that has implications for unraveling the endoribonuclease function of APE1 in vivo.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21762700&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     THERMODYNAMICS AND KINETICS OF THE HAIRPIN RIBOZYME FROM ATOMISTIC FOLDING/UNFOLDING SIMULATIONS.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Sep 2 PMID: 21740912<br />Authors: Nivon, L. G. - Shakhnovich, E. I.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />We report a set of atomistic folding/unfolding simulations for the hairpin ribozyme using a Monte Carlo algorithm. The hairpin ribozyme folds in solution and catalyzes self-cleavage or ligation via a specific two-domain structure. The minimal active ribozyme has been studied extensively, showing stabilization of the active structure by cations and dynamic motion of the active structure. Here, we introduce a simple model of tertiary-structure formation that leads to a phase diagram for the RNA as a function of temperature and tertiary-structure strength. We then employ this model to capture many folding/unfolding events and to examine the transition-state ensemble (TSE) of the RNA during folding to its active "docked" conformation. The TSE is compact but with few tertiary interactions formed, in agreement with single-molecule dynamics experiments. To compare with experimental kinetic parameters, we introduce a novel method to benchmark Monte Carlo kinetic parameters to docking/undocking rates collected over many single molecular trajectories. We find that topology alone, as encoded in a biased potential that discriminates between secondary and tertiary interactions, is sufficient to predict the thermodynamic behavior and kinetic folding pathway of the hairpin ribozyme. This method should be useful in predicting folding transition states for many natural or man-made RNA tertiary structures.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21740912&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     TWO-STEP AMINOACYLATION OF TRNA WITHOUT CHANNELING IN ARCHAEA.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 26 PMID: 21726564<br />Authors: Bhaskaran, H. - Perona, J. J.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Catalysis of sequential reactions is often envisaged to occur by channeling of substrate between enzyme active sites without release into bulk solvent. However, while there are compelling physiological rationales for direct substrate transfer, proper experimental support for the hypothesis is often lacking, particularly for metabolic pathways involving RNA. Here, we apply transient kinetics approaches developed to study channeling in bienzyme complexes to an archaeal protein synthesis pathway featuring the misaminoacylated tRNA intermediate Glu-tRNA(Gln). Experimental and computational elucidation of a kinetic and thermodynamic framework for two-step cognate Gln-tRNA(Gln) synthesis demonstrates that the misacylating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS(ND)) and the tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (GatDE) function sequentially without channeling. Instead, rapid processing of the misacylated tRNA intermediate by GatDE and preferential elongation factor binding to the cognate Gln-tRNA(Gln) together permit accurate protein synthesis without formation of a binary protein-protein complex between GluRS(ND) and GatDE. These findings establish an alternate paradigm for protein quality control via two-step pathways for cognate aminoacyl-tRNA formation.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21726564&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     IDENTIFICATION OF 5-HYDROXYCYTIDINE AT POSITION 2501 CONCLUDES CHARACTERIZATION OF MODIFIED NUCLEOTIDES IN E. COLI 23S RRNA.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 19 PMID: 21723290<br />Authors: Havelund, J. F. - Giessing, A. M. - Hansen, T. - Rasmussen, A. - Scott, L. G. - Kirpekar, F.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Complete characterization of a biomolecule's chemical structure is crucial in the full understanding of the relations between their structure and function. The dominating components in ribosomes are ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and the entire rRNA-but a single modified nucleoside at position 2501 in 23S rRNA-has previously been characterized in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Despite a first report nearly 20 years ago, the chemical nature of the modification at position 2501 has remained elusive, and attempts to isolate it have so far been unsuccessful. We unambiguously identify this last unknown modification as 5-hydroxycytidine-a novel modification in RNA. Identification of 5-hydroxycytidine was completed by liquid chromatography under nonoxidizing conditions using a graphitized carbon stationary phase in combination with ion trap tandem mass spectrometry and by comparing the fragmentation behavior of the natural nucleoside with that of a chemically synthesized ditto. Furthermore, we show that 5-hydroxycytidine is also present in the equivalent position of 23S rRNA from the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. Given the unstable nature of 5-hydroxycytidine, this modification might be found in other RNAs when applying the proper analytical conditions as described here.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21723290&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     STRUCTURE OF H/ACA RNP PROTEIN NHP2P REVEALS CIS/TRANS ISOMERIZATION OF A CONSERVED PROLINE AT THE RNA AND NOP10 BINDING INTERFACE.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Sep 2 PMID: 21708174<br />Authors: Koo, B. K. - Park, C. J. - Fernandez, C. F. - Chim, N. - Ding, Y. - Chanfreau, G. - Feigon, J.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />H/ACA small nucleolar and Cajal body ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) function in site-specific pseudouridylation of eukaryotic rRNA and snRNA, rRNA processing, and vertebrate telomerase biogenesis. Nhp2, one of four essential protein components of eukaryotic H/ACA RNPs, forms a core trimer with the pseudouridylase Cbf5 and Nop10 that binds to H/ACA RNAs specifically. Crystal structures of archaeal H/ACA RNPs have revealed how the protein components interact with each other and with the H/ACA RNA. However, in place of Nhp2p, archaeal H/ACA RNPs contain L7Ae, which binds specifically to an RNA K-loop motif absent from eukaryotic H/ACA RNPs, while Nhp2 binds a broader range of RNA structures. We report solution NMR studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nhp2 (Nhp2p), which reveal that Nhp2p exhibits two major conformations in solution due to cis/trans isomerization of the evolutionarily conserved Pro83. The equivalent proline is in the cis conformation in all reported structures of L7Ae and other homologous proteins. Nhp2p has the expected alpha-beta-alpha fold, but the solution structures of the major conformation of Nhp2p with trans Pro83 and of Nhp2p-S82W with cis Pro83 reveal that Pro83 cis/trans isomerization affects the positions of numerous residues at the Nop10 and RNA binding interface. An S82W substitution, which stabilizes the cis conformation, also stabilizes the association of Nhp2p with H/ACA snoRNPs expressed in vivo. We propose that Pro83 plays a key role in the assembly of the eukaryotic H/ACA RNP, with the cis conformation locking in a stable Cbf5-Nop10-Nhp2 ternary complex and positioning the protein backbone to interact with the H/ACA RNA.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21708174&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     REGULATION OF FAT STORAGE AND REPRODUCTION BY KRUPPEL-LIKE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR KLF3 AND FAT-ASSOCIATED GENES IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 19 PMID: 21704635<br />Authors: Zhang, J. - Bakheet, R. - Parhar, R. S. - Huang, C. H. - Hussain, M. M. - Pan, X. - Siddiqui, S. S. - Hashmi, S.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Coordinated regulation of fat storage and utilization is essential for energy homeostasis, and its disruption is associated with metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis in humans. Across species, Kruppel-like transcription factors (KLFs) have been identified as key components of adipogenesis. In humans, KLF14 acts as a master transregulator of adipose gene expression in type 2 diabetes and cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Herein we report that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, mutants in klf-3 accumulate large fat droplets rich in neutral lipids in the intestine; this lipid accumulation is associated with an increase in triglyceride levels. The klf-3 mutants show normal pharyngeal pumping; however, they are sterile or semisterile. We explored important genetic interactions of klf-3 with the genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid (FA) beta-oxidation in mitochondria or peroxisomes and FA synthesis in the cytosol, namely acyl-CoA synthetase (acs-1 and acs-2), acyl-CoA oxidase (F08A8.1 and F08A8.2), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (fat-7). We show that mutations or RNA interference in these genes increases fat deposits in the intestine of acs-1, acs-2, F08A8.1, and F08A8 animals. We further show that acs-1 and F08A8.1 influence larval development and fertility, respectively. Thus, KLF3 may regulate FA utilization in the intestine and reproductive tissue. We demonstrate that depletion of F08A8.1 activity, but not of acs-1, acs-2, F08A8.2, or fat-7 activity, enhances the fat phenotype of the klf-3 mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that klf-3 regulates lipid metabolism, along with acs-1, acs-2, F08A8.1, and F08A8.2, by promoting FA beta-oxidation and, in parallel, may contribute to normal reproductive behavior and fecundity in C. elegans.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21704635&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY REGION GENE 1 IS A DYNAMIC RNA-ASSOCIATED AND ACTIN-BUNDLING PROTEIN.
     ........................................

I. - Bellini, M. - Levesque, L. - Brieher, W. M. - van der Maarel, S. M. - Jones, P. L.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />FSHD region gene 1 (FRG1) is a dynamic nuclear and cytoplasmic protein that, in skeletal muscle, shows additional localization to the sarcomere. Maintaining appropriate levels of FRG1 protein is critical for muscular and vascular development in vertebrates; however, its precise molecular function is unknown. This study investigates the molecular functions of human FRG1, along with mouse FRG1 and Xenopus frg1, using molecular, biochemical, and cellular-biological approaches, to provide further insight into its roles in vertebrate development. The nuclear fraction of the endogenous FRG1 is localized in nucleoli, Cajal bodies, and actively transcribed chromatin; however, contrary to overexpressed FRG1, the endogenous FRG1 is not associated with nuclear speckles. We characterize the nuclear and nucleolar import of FRG1, the potential effect of phosphorylation, and its interaction with the importin karyopherin alpha2. Consistent with a role in RNA biogenesis, human FRG1 is associated with mRNA in vivo and invitro, interacts directly with TAP (Tip-associated protein; the major mRNA export receptor), and is a dynamic nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein supporting a function for FRG1 in mRNA transport. Biochemically, we characterize FRG1 actin binding activity and show that the cytoplasmic pool of FRG1 is dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton for its localization. These data provide the first biochemical activities (actin binding and RNA binding) for human FRG1 and the characterization of the endogenous human FRG1, together indicating that FRG1 is involved in multiple aspects of RNA biogenesis, including mRNA transport and, potentially, cytoplasmic mRNA localization.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21699900&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     FUNCTIONAL COUPLING BETWEEN A DISTAL INTERACTION AND THE CLEAVAGE SITE IN BACTERIAL RNASE-P-RNA-MEDIATED CLEAVAGE.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 12 PMID: 21689663<br />Authors: Wu, S. - Chen, Y. - Lindell, M. - Mao, G. - Kirsebom, L. A.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Bacterial RNase P consists of one protein and one RNA [RNase P RNA (RPR)]. RPR can process tRNA precursors correctly in the absence of the protein. Here we have used model hairpin loop substrates corresponding to the acceptor, T-stem, and T-loop of a precursor tRNA to study the importance of the T-loop structure in RPR-alone reaction. T-stem/loop (TSL) interacts with a region in RPR [TSL binding site (TBS)], forming TSL/TBS interaction. Altering the T-loop structure affects both cleavage site selection and rate of cleavage at the correct site +1 and at the alternative site -1. The magnitude of variation depended on the structures of the T-loop and the TBS region, with as much as a 150-fold reduction in the rate of cleavage at +1. Interestingly, for one T-loop structure mutant, no difference in the rate at -1 was detected compared to cleavage of the substrate with an unchanged T-loop, indicating that, in this case, the altered T-loop structure primarily influences events required for efficient cleavage at the correct site +1. We also provide data supporting a functional link between a productive TSL/TBS interaction and events at the cleavage site. Collectively, our findings emphasize the interplay between separate regions upon formation of a productive RPR substrate that leads to efficient and accurate cleavage. These new data provide support for an induced-fit mechanism in bacterial RPR-mediated cleavage at the correct site +1.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21689663&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     COOPERATIVE RNP ASSEMBLY: COMPLEMENTARY RESCUE OF STRUCTURAL DEFECTS BY PROTEIN AND RNA SUBUNITS OF ARCHAEAL RNASE P.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 12 PMID: 21683084<br />Authors: Chen, W. Y. - Xu, Y. - Cho, I. M. - Oruganti, S. V. - Foster, M. P. - Gopalan, V.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ribonucleoprotein complex that utilizes a Mg(2+)-dependent RNA catalyst to cleave the 5' leader of precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) and generate mature tRNAs. The bacterial RNase P protein (RPP) aids RNase P RNA (RPR) catalysis by promoting substrate binding, Mg(2+) coordination and product release. Archaeal RNase P comprises an RPR and at least four RPPs, which have eukaryal homologs and function as two binary complexes (POP5.RPP30 and RPP21.RPP29). Here, we employed a previously characterized substrate-enzyme conjugate [pre-tRNA(Tyr)-Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mja) RPR] to investigate the functional role of a universally conserved uridine in a bulge-helix structure in archaeal RPRs. Deletion of this bulged uridine resulted in an 80-fold decrease in the self-cleavage rate of pre-tRNA(Tyr)-MjaDeltaU RPR compared to the wild type, and this defect was partially ameliorated upon addition of either RPP pair. The catalytic defect in the archaeal mutant RPR mirrors that reported in a bacterial RPR and highlights a parallel in their active sites. Furthermore, an N-terminal deletion mutant of Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) RPP29 that is defective in assembling with its binary partner RPP21, as assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy, is functional when reconstituted with the cognate Pfu RPR. Collectively, these results indicate that archaeal RPPs are able to compensate for structural defects in their cognate RPR and vice-versa, and provide striking examples of the cooperative subunit interactions critical for driving archaeal RNase P toward its functional conformation.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21683084&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     HOXC6 IS TRANSCRIPTIONALLY REGULATED VIA COORDINATION OF MLL HISTONE METHYLASE AND ESTROGEN RECEPTOR IN AN ESTROGEN ENVIRONMENT.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 12 PMID: 21683083<br />Authors: Ansari, K. I. - Hussain, I. - Shrestha, B. - Kasiri, S. - Mandal, S. S.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Homeobox (HOX)-containing gene HOXC6 is a critical player in mammary gland development and milk production, and is overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers. We demonstrated that HOXC6 is transcriptionally regulated by estrogen (E2). HOXC6 promoter contains two putative estrogen response elements (EREs), termed as ERE1(1/2) and ERE2(1/2). Promoter analysis using luciferase-based reporter assay demonstrated that both EREs are responsive to E2, with ERE1(1/2) being more responsive than ERE2(1/2). Estrogen receptors (ERs) ERalpha and ERbeta bind to these EREs in an E2-dependent manner, and antisense-mediated knockdown of ERs suppressed the E2-dependent activation of HOXC6 expression. Similarly, knockdown of histone methylases MLL2 and MLL3 decreased the E2-mediated activation of HOXC6. However, depletion of MLL1 or MLL4 showed no significant effect. MLL2 and MLL3 were bound to the HOXC6 EREs in an E2-dependent manner. In contrast, MLL1 and MLL4 that were bound to the HOXC6 promoter in the absence of E2 decreased upon exposure to E2. MLL2 and MLL3 play key roles in histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation and in the recruitment of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II in the HOXC6 promoter during E2-dependent transactivation. Nuclear receptor corepressors N-CoR and SAFB1 were bound in the HOXC6 promoter in the absence of E2, and that binding was decreased upon E2 treatment, indicating their critical roles in suppressing HOXC6 gene expression under nonactivated conditions. Knockdown of either ERalpha or ERbeta abolished E2-dependent recruitment of MLL2 and MLL3 into the HOXC6 promoter, demonstrating key roles of ERs in the recruitment of these mixed lineage leukemias into the HOXC6 promoter. Overall, our studies demonstrated that HOXC6 is an E2-responsive gene, and that histone methylases MLL2 and MLL3, in coordination with ERalpha and ERbeta, transcriptionally regulate HOXC6 in an E2-dependent manner.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21683083&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     ATP-DEPENDENT ROLES OF THE DEAD-BOX PROTEIN MSS116P IN GROUP II INTRON SPLICING IN VITRO AND IN VIVO.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 19 PMID: 21679717<br />Authors: Potratz, J. P. - Del Campo, M. - Wolf, R. Z. - Lambowitz, A. M. - Russell, R.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />The yeast DEAD-box protein Mss116p functions as a general RNA chaperone in splicing mitochondrial group I and group II introns. For most of its functions, Mss116p is thought to use ATP-dependent RNA unwinding to facilitate RNA structural transitions, but it has been suggested to assist in the folding of one group II intron (aI5gamma) primarily by stabilizing a folding intermediate. Here we compare three aI5gamma constructs: one with long exons, one with short exons, and a ribozyme construct lacking exons. The long exons result in slower splicing, suggesting that they misfold and/or stabilize nonnative intronic structures. Nevertheless, Mss116p acceleration of all three constructs depends on ATP and is inhibited by mutations that compromise RNA unwinding, suggesting similar mechanisms. Results of splicing assays and a new two-stage assay that separates ribozyme folding and catalysis indicate that maximal folding of all three constructs by Mss116p requires ATP-dependent RNA unwinding. ATP-independent activation is appreciable for only a subpopulation of the minimal ribozyme construct and not for constructs containing exons. As expected for a general RNA chaperone, Mss116p can also disrupt the native ribozyme, which can refold after Mss116p removal. Finally, using yeast strains with mitochondrial DNA containing only the single intron aI5gamma, we show that Mss116p mutants promote splicing in vivo to degrees that correlate with their residual ATP-dependent RNA-unwinding activities. Together, our results indicate that, although DEAD-box proteins play multiple roles in RNA folding, the physiological function of Mss116p in aI5gamma splicing includes a requirement for ATP-dependent local unfolding, allowing the conversion of nonfunctional RNA structure into functional RNA structure.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21679717&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>

     EVOLUTIONARY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CODING AND SPLICING REGULATORY REGIONS IN THE FIBRONECTIN EDA EXON.
     ........................................
     Publication Date: 2011 Aug 5 PMID: 21663748<br />Authors: Zago, P. - Buratti, E. - Stuani, C. - Baralle, F. E.<br />Journal: J Mol Biol<br /><br />Research on exonic coding sequences has demonstrated that many substitutions at the amino acid level may also reflect profound changes at the level of splicing regulatory regions. These results have revealed that, for many alternatively spliced exons, there is considerable pressure to strike a balance between two different and sometimes conflicting forces: the drive to improve the quality and production efficiency of proteins and the maintenance of proper exon recognition by the splicing machinery. Up to now, the systems used to investigate these connections have mostly focused on short alternatively spliced exons that contain a high density of splicing regulatory elements. Although this is obviously a desirable feature in order to maximize the chances of spotting connections, it also complicates the process of drawing straightforward evolutionary pathways between different species (because of the numerous alternative pathways through which the same end point can be achieved). The alternatively spliced fibronectin extra domain A exon (also referred to as EDI or EIIIA) does not have these limitations, as its inclusion is already known to depend on a single exonic splicing enhancer element within its sequence. In this study, we have compared the rat and human fibronectin EDA exons with regard to RNA structure, exonic splicing enhancer strengths, and SR protein occupancy. The results gained from these analyses have then been used to perform an accurate evaluation of EDA sequences observed in a wide range of animal species. This comparison strongly suggests the existence of an evolutionary connection between changes at the nucleotide levels and the need to maintain efficient EDA recognition in different species.<br /><br />post to: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/posturl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Fquery.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26db%3DPubMed%26dopt%3DAbstract%26list_uids%3D21663748&amp;title=Entrez+Pubmed">CiteULike</a>
